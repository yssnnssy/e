soros

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:55,840
who truly needs no introduction

46
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,158
thank you very much and thank you for

47
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,359
all for

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,359
coming and both here and in london

49
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:11,840
in the course of of my life i've

50
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,959
developed a conceptual framework

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,360
which has helped me both in

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,479
make money making money as a hedge fund

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
manager

54
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:25,679
and in spending it as a policy oriented

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,479
philanthropist but the framework itself

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,480
is not about money it's about the

57
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,439
relationship between thinking

58
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:36,159
and reality a subject that is

59
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:39,039
extensively studied by philosophers

60
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,039
from early on

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
i started developing my philosophy as a

62
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,399
student

63
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,238
at the london school of economics in the

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,760
late 1950s

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,719
i took my final exams one year early

66
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,280
and i had a year to fill before i was

67
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,318
qualified to receive my degree

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,680
i could choose my own tutor and i chose

69
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,919
karl popper

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,800
who whose book the open society and its

71
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,199
enemies

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,640
had made a profound impression on me

73
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:19,119
in his books popper argued

74
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:22,318
that the empirical truth can't be known

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,000
with absolute certainty even

76
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:28,719
scientific laws can't be verified

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
beyond the shadow of a doubt they can

78
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,439
only be

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,799
falsified by testing one fair test

80
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,318
is enough to to falsify but no amount of

81
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,439
confirming instances

82
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,919
is sufficient to verify

83
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,799
scientific laws are hypothetical in

84
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,439
character

85
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,640
and their truth remains subject to

86
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,959
testing

87
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,119
ideologies which claim to be in

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,158
possession of the ultimate truth

89
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,200
are making a false claim therefore

90
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,239
they can be imposed on society only by

91
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,280
force

92
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,920
this applies to communism fascism and

93
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,239
national socialism alike

94
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:13,199
all these ideologies lead to repression

95
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,680
papa proposed a more attractive form of

96
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,079
social

97
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,519
organization a society an open society

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,040
in which people are free to hold diverse

99
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,680
divergent opinions and the rule of law

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,879
allows people with different views and

101
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,079
different interests

102
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,159
to live together in peace

103
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,800
having lived through both nazi and

104
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,759
communist occupation here in hungary

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,840
i found the idea of an open society

106
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,479
immensely

107
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:47,679
attractive while i was reading popper

108
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,399
i was also studying economic theory

109
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,519
and i was struck by the contradiction

110
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,519
between

111
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,719
papa's emphasis on imperfect

112
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,439
understanding

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,320
and the theory of perfect competition in

114
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,199
economics

115
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,639
which postulated perfect knowledge this

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,199
led me to start

117
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,319
questioning the assumptions of economic

118
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,680
theory

119
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,719
these were the two major

120
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,759
inspirations of my philosophy

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,160
it's also deeply rooted in my personal

122
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,160
history

123
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,800
the formative the formative experience

124
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,478
of my life

125
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,038
was the german occupation of hungary in

126
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,000
1944

127
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,079
i was not yet 14 years old at the time

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
coming from a reasonably well to do

129
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,159
middle class background

130
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
suddenly confronted with the prospect of

131
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,000
being deported and killed

132
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:44,959
just because i was jewish fortunately

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,360
my father was well prepared for this far

134
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,799
from equilibrium experience

135
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
he had lived through the russian

136
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,800
revolution and that was diplomatic

137
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,439
experience of his life until then

138
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,600
he had been an ambitious young man when

139
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,319
the first world war broke out

140
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,199
he volunteered to serve in the

141
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,960
austro-hungarian army

142
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,800
he was captured by the russians and

143
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,638
taken as a prisoner of war

144
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,120
to siberia being ambitious he became

145
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,319
the editor of a newspaper produced by

146
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,360
the prisoners

147
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,000
it was hand written and displayed on a

148
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,199
plank

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,079
and it was called the plank this made

150
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,879
him

151
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,680
so popular that he was elected the

152
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,639
prisoner's

153
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,519
representative then some soldiers

154
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,918
escaped

155
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,680
from a neighboring camp and their

156
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,680
prisoners representative

157
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,800
was shot in retaliation my father

158
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,759
is instead of waiting

159
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,079
for the same thing to happen in his camp

160
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,199
organized a breakout

161
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:52,240
his plan was to build a raft

162
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,560
and sail down to the ocean

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,918
but his knowledge of geography was

164
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,959
somewhat deficient

165
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:02,079
he didn't realize that all the rivers

166
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,560
in siberia flow into the arctic

167
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,199
they drifted for several weeks before

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,598
their

169
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,478
they realized that they were heading for

170
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,439
the arctic

171
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,159
and it took them several more months to

172
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,360
make their

173
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,400
way back to civilization across the

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,879
tiger

175
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,918
in the meantime the russian revolution

176
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,680
broke out

177
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:27,038
and they became caught up in it

178
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,160
only after a variety of adventures

179
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:33,038
did my father manage to find his way

180
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,400
back to hungary had he remained in the

181
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,240
camp he would have

182
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,239
arrived home much sooner

183
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,360
my father came home a changed man

184
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,279
his experiences during the russian

185
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,240
revolution profoundly

186
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,359
profoundly affected him he lost his

187
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
ambition

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,360
and wanted nothing more from life than

189
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,560
to enjoy it

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,720
he imparted to his children values that

191
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,918
were very different from those

192
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,319
of the milieu in which we lived he had

193
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,959
no desire to amass wealth

194
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,000
or become socially prominent on the

195
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,198
contrary

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,959
he worked only as much as was necessary

197
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:18,240
to make ends meet i remember being sent

198
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:21,120
to his main client to borrow some money

199
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
before we went on a skiing holiday my

200
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,598
father was grouchy for

201
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,079
months afterwards because he had to work

202
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,439
to pay

203
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:32,478
it back although we were

204
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,479
reasonably prosperous we were not the

205
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,639
typical bourgeois family

206
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,639
and we were proud of being different

207
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,680
in 1944 when

208
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:49,039
the germans occupied hungary my father

209
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:52,079
immediately realized that these were not

210
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,879
normal times and the normal rules

211
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,839
didn't apply he arranged false

212
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,720
identities

213
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,080
for his family and the number number of

214
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
other people

215
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,320
those who could paid

216
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:11,278
others he held for free most of them

217
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,278
survived that was his finest hour

218
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,559
living with false identity turned out to

219
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,199
be an

220
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:24,319
exhilarating experience for me too

221
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,200
we were in mortal danger people

222
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,879
perished all around us but we managed

223
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,600
not only to survive

224
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,200
but to help other people we were on the

225
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,839
side of the angels

226
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,879
and we triumphed against overwhelming

227
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,920
odds

228
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,958
this made me feel very special

229
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,519
it was high adventure i had a reliable

230
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,119
guide

231
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:52,080
in my father and came through unscathed

232
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:55,679
what more could a 14 year old ask for

233
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,200
after the euphoric experience

234
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:02,639
of escaping the nazis life in hungary

235
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,720
started to lose its luster during the

236
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,039
soviet occupation

237
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
i was looking for new challenges and

238
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,838
with the help of my father

239
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,720
i found my way out of hungary when i was

240
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,000
17

241
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,120
i became a student in london in my

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
studies

243
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
my primary interest was to gain a better

244
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,320
understanding

245
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,600
of the strange world into which i had

246
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,079
been born

247
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,200
but i have to confess i i also harbored

248
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,838
some fantasies of become becoming an

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,680
important

250
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,399
philosopher i believed that i had gained

251
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,799
insights that set me apart from other

252
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,799
people

253
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,199
living in london was a bit was a big

254
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,720
letdown

255
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,000
i was without money alone and people

256
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,240
were not interested in what i had to say

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
but i didn't abandon my philosophical

258
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,440
ambitions

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,399
even when circumstances forced me to

260
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,440
make a living

261
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,559
in more mundane pursuits

262
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,560
after completing my studies i had a

263
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,599
number of false starts

264
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,479
finally i ended up as an arbitrage

265
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,519
trader

266
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,639
in new york but in my free time

267
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,919
i continued to work on my philosophy

268
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:25,439
that's how i came to write my first

269
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,199
major essay entitled the burden of

270
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,560
consciousness

271
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,519
it was an attempt to model a purpose

272
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,799
framework

273
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,440
of open and close societies it linked

274
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,639
organic society with a traditional mode

275
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,000
of thinking

276
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,838
close society with a dogmatic mode

277
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,958
and uh and open society with a critical

278
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,639
mode

279
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:53,518
what i could not properly resolve was

280
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,039
the nature of the relationship between

281
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,078
the mode of thinking

282
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,879
and the actual state of affairs that

283
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,638
problem

284
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:05,240
continued to preoccupy me and that's how

285
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,720
i came to develop the concept of

286
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,600
reflexivity

287
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,399
a concept i shall explore in greater

288
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,600
detail

289
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,600
a little later it so happened

290
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,439
that the concept of reflexivity provided

291
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,679
me

292
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,800
with a new way of looking at financial

293
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,919
markets

294
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:28,078
a better way than the prevailing theory

295
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,599
this gave me an edge first as a

296
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,278
securities analyst

297
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,680
and then as a hedge fund manager i felt

298
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,958
as if i were in possession of a major

299
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,199
discovery

300
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,078
that would enable me to fulfill my

301
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
fantasy

302
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,759
of becoming an important philosopher

303
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,278
at a certain moment when my business

304
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,799
career

305
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,200
ran into a roadblock i shifted gears

306
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,399
and devoted all my energies to

307
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,320
developing

308
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,600
my theory but i treasured my discovery

309
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,800
so much

310
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,600
that i couldn't part with it i felt

311
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,000
that the concept of reflexivity needed

312
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,480
to be

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,519
explored in great depth as i delved

314
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,560
deeper and deeper into the subject

315
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,679
i got lost in the intricacies of my own

316
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,159
constructions one morning

317
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,679
i couldn't understand what i had written

318
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,480
the night before

319
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,399
at that point i decided to abandon my

320
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,159
philosophical explorations

321
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,159
and to focus on making money

322
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,879
it was only many years later after a

323
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,920
successful run as a hedge fund manager

324
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:46,240
that returned to my philosophy

325
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:50,958
i published my first uh first

326
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:54,560
essay the the the alchemy of finance

327
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:57,278
in 1987. in that book

328
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,198
i tried to explain the philosophical

329
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,799
underpinnings of my approach

330
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:05,599
to financial markets the book attracted

331
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,719
a certain amount of attention it has

332
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,278
been read

333
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,240
by by most people in the hedge fund

334
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,958
industry

335
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
and it is thought in business schools

336
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,239
but the

337
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,639
philosophical arguments didn't make much

338
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,480
of an

339
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,799
impression they were largely dismissed

340
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,560
as the conceit of a man who has been

341
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:29,039
successful in business

342
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:32,159
and fancied himself as a philosopher

343
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,639
i myself came to doubt

344
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,000
whether i was in possession of a major

345
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,480
new insight

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,879
after all i was dealing with a subject

347
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,320
that has been explored by philosophers

348
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,519
since time immemorial what grounds did i

349
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,720
have for thinking

350
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,120
that i had made a new discovery

351
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,240
especially as nobody else seems to think

352
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,600
so

353
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,560
undoubtedly the conceptual framework

354
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,720
was useful to me personally but it

355
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,799
didn't seem to be

356
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,800
equally value considered equally

357
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,599
valuable by others

358
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,559
i had to accept that judgment i didn't

359
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
give up

360
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,559
my philosophical interests but i came to

361
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,240
regret them as

362
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,719
a personal predilection i continued to

363
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,919
be

364
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,199
guided by my conceptual framework both

365
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,919
in my business and in my philanthropic

366
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,719
activities which came to assume an

367
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,879
increasingly important role in my life

368
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,720
and each time i wrote a book i

369
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,480
faithfully recited

370
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,440
my arguments this helped me to develop

371
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,159
my conceptual framework but i can

372
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,440
consider

373
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:46,639
continued to consider myself a failed

374
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,360
philosopher once i even gave a lecture

375
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,480
with the with the title a failed

376
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,480
philosopher

377
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,320
tried twice again

378
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,839
all this has changed as a result

379
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,120
of the financial crisis of 2008.

380
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,040
my conceptual framework enabled me both

381
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,440
to anticipate the crisis

382
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,399
and to deal with it when it finally

383
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,600
struck

384
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,720
it has also enabled me to explain

385
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,240
and predict events better than most

386
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,360
others

387
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:25,278
this has changed my own

388
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,800
evaluation and that of many others

389
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:31,519
my philosophy is no longer a

390
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,559
personal matter it deserves to be taken

391
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,959
seriously

392
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,879
as a possible contribution to our

393
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,239
understanding of reality

394
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:44,720
and that is what has prompted me to give

395
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,720
this series of lectures

396
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,480
so here it goes

397
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:59,119
today i shall explain the concept

398
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,800
of ref of fallibility and reflexivity

399
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,759
in general terms tomorrow i shall apply

400
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,198
them

401
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,640
to the financial markets and after that

402
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,519
to politics that will also bring in

403
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,880
the concept of open society in the

404
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,359
fourth lecture

405
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,640
i shall explore the difference between

406
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,678
market values

407
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,799
and moral values and in the fifth i

408
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,839
shall give

409
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:33,839
some predictions and prescriptions

410
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:33,839
for the present moment in history

411
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:44,240
i can state the core idea

412
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:47,759
in two relatively simple propositions

413
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,640
one is that the situation

414
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,960
that has thinking participants the

415
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,559
participants view of the world

416
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,160
is always partial and distorted

417
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,279
that's the principle of fallibility the

418
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,558
other is

419
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:07,599
that these distorted views can

420
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:11,279
influence the situation to which

421
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:14,480
they relate because false views

422
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:18,319
lead to inappropriate actions

423
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,919
that's the principle of reflexivity

424
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:25,759
for instance treating drug addicts

425
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,400
as criminals creates criminal behavior

426
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,480
it misconstrues the problem and

427
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,320
interferes with the proper treatment of

428
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,440
addicts

429
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,960
as another example declaring

430
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,759
that government is bad tends to make for

431
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,038
bad government

432
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:48,160
both fallibility and reflexivity

433
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,960
are sheer common sense so when my

434
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,480
critics

435
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,759
say that i am merely stating the obvious

436
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,720
they are right up to a point

437
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,720
what makes my propositions interesting

438
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,279
is that their significance

439
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,720
significance has not been generally

440
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:08,079
appreciated

441
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,880
the concept of reflexivity in particular

442
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,759
has been studiously avoided and even

443
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,600
denied

444
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:18,400
by economic theory so my conceptual

445
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,480
framework deserves to be taken seriously

446
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,519
not because it constitutes a new

447
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,240
discovery

448
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,759
but because something as commonsensical

449
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,798
as reflexivity

450
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,798
has been so studiously ignored

451
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,240
recognizing reflexivity has been

452
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,880
sacrificed

453
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,160
to the vain pursuit of certainty in

454
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,840
human affairs

455
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,200
mostly most notably in economics

456
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:51,038
and yet uncertainty is the key feature

457
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:54,080
of human affairs economic theory

458
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,480
is built on the concept of equilibrium

459
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,439
and that concept is in direct

460
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,720
contradiction

461
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,840
with the concept of reflexivity as i

462
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,600
shall try to show

463
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:08,480
in the next lecture the two concepts

464
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,678
yield to two entirely different

465
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,200
interpretations

466
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,720
of financial markets

467
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,720
the concept of fallibility is far less

468
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,120
controversial

469
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,480
it's generally recognized that the

470
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,599
complexity of the world

471
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,200
in which we live exceeds our capacity to

472
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,719
comprehend it

473
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,360
i have no great new insights to offer

474
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,880
the main source of difficulty is that

475
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,678
participants are part

476
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,640
of the situation they have to deal with

477
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,400
confronted

478
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,200
by a reality of extreme complexity

479
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,640
we are obliged to resort to various

480
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,080
methods of simplification

481
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:55,840
generalizations dichotomies metaphors

482
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,119
decision rules moral precepts to mention

483
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,158
just a few

484
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:02,319
these mental constructs take on an

485
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,200
existence of their own

486
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,519
further complicated complicating the

487
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,240
situation

488
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,240
the structure of the brain is another

489
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,038
source of distortions

490
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,159
recent advances in brain science have

491
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,558
begun to provide

492
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,520
some insight into how the brain

493
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,558
functions

494
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:26,240
and they have substantiated hume's

495
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,678
contention that reason is the slave of

496
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,038
passion

497
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,840
the idea of a disembodied intellect or

498
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:36,158
reason

499
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:39,279
is a figment of our imagination

500
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,799
the being the brain is bombarded

501
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:46,798
by millions of sensory impulses

502
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:50,079
but consciousness can only process only

503
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:53,038
seven or eight subjects concurrently

504
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,678
the impulses need to be condensed

505
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,400
ordered

506
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,360
and interpreted under events time

507
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,759
pressure

508
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,038
and mistakes and distortions can't be

509
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,400
avoided

510
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:06,879
brain science adds many new details

511
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,640
to my original contention that our

512
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
understanding of the world in which we

513
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,840
live

514
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,840
is inherently imperfect

515
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,799
the concept of reflexivity needs

516
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,959
a little more explanation it applies

517
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,038
exclusively to situations that have

518
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,840
thinking participants

519
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,038
the participants thinking serves two

520
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,839
functions

521
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,640
one is to understand the world in which

522
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,678
we live

523
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,799
i call this the cognitive function

524
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,320
the other is to change the situation to

525
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,558
our advantage

526
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:49,678
i call this the part the manipulating

527
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,798
or participating function the two

528
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,159
functions

529
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:57,839
connect thinking and reality in opposite

530
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:01,200
directions in the cognitive function

531
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:03,038
reality is supposed to determine at the

532
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,319
participants views

533
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,038
the direction of causation is from the

534
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,079
world

535
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,079
to the mind by contrast in the

536
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,038
manipulative function

537
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,599
the direction of causation is from the

538
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,640
mind

539
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,879
to the world that is to say the

540
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,600
intentions of the participants have an

541
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,039
effect

542
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,558
on the world when both functions operate

543
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:31,440
at the same time

544
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:34,399
they can interfere with each other how

545
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,320
by depriving each function of the

546
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,798
independent variable

547
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:41,839
that would be needed to determine the

548
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:45,599
value of the dependent variable

549
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:47,839
because when the independent variable

550
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,759
of one function is the dependent

551
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,678
variable of the other

552
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,679
neither function has a genuinely

553
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,278
independent variable

554
00:23:53,679 --> 00:24:00,320
this means that the cognitive function

555
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,519
can't produce enough knowledge to serve

556
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,359
as the basis

557
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:08,558
of the participants decisions similarly

558
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,798
the manipulative function can can have

559
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,960
an

560
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,240
effect on the outcome but can't

561
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,120
determine it

562
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,319
in other words the outcome is liable to

563
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,519
diverge

564
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:22,079
from the participants intentions

565
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,720
there is bound to be some slippage

566
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,918
between

567
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,120
intentions and actions and further

568
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,120
slippage

569
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:33,759
between actions and outcomes

570
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,199
as a result there is an element of

571
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,558
uncertainty

572
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,600
both in our understanding of reality

573
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:44,839
and in the actual course of in

574
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:48,158
events to

575
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:51,278
understand the uncertainties

576
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,480
associated with reflexivity we need to

577
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,839
probe a little

578
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,038
further if the cognitive function

579
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,879
operated in isolation without any

580
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:01,679
interference from the manipulative

581
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,960
function

582
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,919
it could produce knowledge knowledge is

583
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,600
represented by two statements a

584
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,159
statement is true

585
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,399
if it corresponds to the facts that's

586
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,760
what the correspondence theory of truth

587
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:21,038
tells us but if there is

588
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:24,720
interference from

589
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:28,000
the the manipulative function

590
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,278
the facts no longer serve as an

591
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,519
independent criterion by which the truth

592
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,440
of a statement can be judged

593
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,639
because the correspondence may have been

594
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,798
brought about

595
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:46,320
by the statement changing the facts

596
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:49,839
consider the statement it's raining

597
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,480
that statement is true or false

598
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,839
depending on whether it is in fact

599
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,720
raining

600
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,879
now consider the statement this is a

601
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,759
revolutionary moment

602
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,159
that statement is reflexive and this

603
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:08,079
truth value depends on the impact

604
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:11,120
it makes reflexive statements

605
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,240
have some affinity with the paradox of

606
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,839
the liar

607
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,558
which is a self-referential statement

608
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,399
but while self-reference has been

609
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:23,759
extensively analyzed

610
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,400
reflexivity has received much less

611
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:30,240
attention that's strange because

612
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,960
reflexivity has an impact on the real

613
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,038
world

614
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,079
while self-reference is purely a

615
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,720
linguistic

616
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:41,119
phenomenon in the real world

617
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,480
the participants thinking finds

618
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,439
expression

619
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,720
not only in statements but also in

620
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,679
various forms of

621
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,038
action and behavior that makes

622
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,400
reflexivity

623
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:57,759
a very broad phenomenon that typically

624
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,720
takes the form of feedback loops

625
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,079
the participants views influence the

626
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,640
course of events

627
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,240
and the course of events influences the

628
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,520
participants views

629
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,400
the influence is continuous and circular

630
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,119
that's what makes that's what turns it

631
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,559
into

632
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,558
a feedback loop

633
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:23,839
reflexive feedback loops have not been

634
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,839
rigorously analyzed and when i

635
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,558
originally encountered them

636
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:31,278
and tried to analyze them i ran into

637
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:34,398
various complications

638
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,640
the feedback loop is supposed to be

639
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,158
a two-way connection between the

640
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,038
participants views

641
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,840
and the actual course of events but what

642
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,158
about

643
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,158
a two-way connection between the

644
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,320
participants views

645
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,600
and what about the solitary individual

646
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,960
asking himself

647
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:56,319
who he is and what he stands for and

648
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,000
changing his behavior as a result of his

649
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,839
reflections

650
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,359
in trying to resolve these difficulties

651
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,639
i got so long lost among the categories

652
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,599
i created

653
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,919
that one morning i couldn't understand

654
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,079
what i had written the night before

655
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,520
that's when i gave up philosophy and

656
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,480
devoted my efforts

657
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,480
to making money

658
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,159
so to avoid that trap

659
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,839
let me propose the following the

660
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,320
terminology

661
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,278
let's distinguish between the objective

662
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:41,839
and subjective aspects of reality

663
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,359
thinking constitutes the subjective

664
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:47,759
aspect

665
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:50,639
events the objective in other words

666
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,119
the subjective aspect covers what takes

667
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,440
place

668
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,719
in the minds of the participants the

669
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,759
objective aspect

670
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,558
denotes what takes place in this in

671
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,519
external

672
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,480
reality there's only one external

673
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,480
reality

674
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,720
but many different subjective views

675
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,000
reflexivity

676
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,519
can then connect any two or more aspects

677
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,759
of reality setting up two-way

678
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,398
feedback loops exceptionally it may even

679
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,759
occur

680
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:24,158
within a single aspect of reality as in

681
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,879
the case of a solitary individual

682
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,760
reflecting on his own identity this may

683
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,960
be described

684
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,839
as self reflexivity

685
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,480
we may then distinguish between two

686
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,000
broad

687
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,278
categories reflexive relationships

688
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
which connect the subjective aspects and

689
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,319
reflexive events which involve the

690
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,759
objective aspect as well

691
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:52,798
marriage is a reflexive relationship

692
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:56,798
the crash of 2008

693
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:59,278
was a reflexive event when reality has

694
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:09,839
no subjective aspect

695
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:09,839
there can be no reflexivity

696
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:20,079
feedback pollutes can be either negative

697
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,440
or positive negative feedback

698
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:26,639
it brings the participants views and

699
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,200
the actual situation closer together

700
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,480
positive feedback drives them further

701
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,319
apart

702
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,558
in other words negative feedback

703
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:41,119
is self-correcting it can go on forever

704
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,918
if and if there are no significant

705
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,119
changes

706
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,679
in external reality it may eventually

707
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,639
lead

708
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,519
to an equilibrium where the participants

709
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,000
views

710
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,278
come to correspond to the actual state

711
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,679
of affairs

712
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,679
that is what's supposed to happen in

713
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,278
financial markets

714
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:05,278
so equilibrium which is the central case

715
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:08,558
in economics turns out to be

716
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:13,200
a limiting case

717
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,200
in my conceptual framework

718
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:22,879
by contrast a positive feedback process

719
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,759
is self-reinforcing it can't go on

720
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,080
forever

721
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,960
because eventually the participants

722
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,359
views

723
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,200
would become so far removed from

724
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,678
objective reality

725
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,038
that the participants would have to

726
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,640
recognize them

727
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,200
as unrealistic nor can the iterative

728
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,919
process

729
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,278
occur without any change in the actual

730
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,000
state of affairs

731
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,960
because it's in the nature of positive

732
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,599
feedback

733
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,319
that it reinforces whatever tendency

734
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,240
prevails

735
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:56,839
in the real world instead of equilibrium

736
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,240
we are faced with a dynamic

737
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:01,359
disequilibrium

738
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,480
or what may be described as far from

739
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,599
equilibrium

740
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,640
conditions usually

741
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,839
in far from equilibrium situations the

742
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,038
divergence

743
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,639
between perceptions and reality leads to

744
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,519
a climax

745
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,399
which sets emotion a positive feedback

746
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,519
process

747
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:24,079
in the opposite direction such

748
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,159
initially self-reinforcing but

749
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,918
eventually self-defeating

750
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:35,039
boom bust processes or bubbles

751
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:38,080
are characteristic of financial markets

752
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:41,759
but they can also be observed

753
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:45,038
in other spheres there i call them

754
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,079
fertile fallacies interpretations of

755
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,359
reality

756
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:53,519
that are distorted yet produce results

757
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,519
which reinforce the distortion

758
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,558
i realize that this is all very abstract

759
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,799
and difficult to follow it would be it

760
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,918
would make it much easier if i gave

761
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:08,158
some concrete examples but

762
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,600
you'll have to bear with me i want to

763
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,159
make a different point

764
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,918
and the fact that it's so difficult to

765
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,559
follow abstract arguments

766
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,519
helps me to make it in dealing with

767
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,000
subjects like

768
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,880
reality or thinking or the relationship

769
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,079
between thinking

770
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,120
and reality it's easy to get

771
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:31,158
confused and formulate problems

772
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,479
the wrong way so misinterpretations and

773
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:35,360
misconceptions

774
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,079
can play a very important role in your

775
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,439
role

776
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:43,199
in human affairs the recent financial

777
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,558
crisis can be attributed to a mistaken

778
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,759
interpretation

779
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,639
of how financial markets work i shall

780
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,919
discuss that

781
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,960
in the next lecture in the third

782
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,159
lecture i shall discuss two fertile

783
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,480
fallacies

784
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,600
the enlightenment fallacy and the

785
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,798
postmodern

786
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,839
fallacy these concrete examples will

787
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,119
demonstrate

788
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,440
how important misconceptions have been

789
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,159
in the course of history but for the

790
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,559
rest of this lecture i shall stay at the

791
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,559
lofty heights of abstraction

792
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:25,918
i contend that situations

793
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,919
that have thinking participants

794
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,000
have a different structure from

795
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,280
natural phenomena the different

796
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,639
difference lies

797
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,399
in the role of thinking in a natural

798
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,919
phenomena

799
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:46,000
thinking plays no causal role

800
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:49,118
and serves only a cognitive function

801
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,239
in human affairs thinking is

802
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,119
part of the subject matter and serves

803
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,158
both

804
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,599
a cognitive and a manipulative

805
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,079
function the two functions can

806
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,119
interfere with each other the

807
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,839
interference

808
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,119
doesn't occur all the time in everyday

809
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,880
activities like

810
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,200
driving a car or painting a house

811
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,160
the two functions actually complement

812
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,159
each other

813
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:19,920
but when it occurs it introduces an

814
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:24,879
element of uncertainty

815
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:28,240
which is absent from natural phenomena

816
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,358
the uncertainty manifests itself in both

817
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,479
functions

818
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,199
the participants act on the basis of

819
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,838
imperfect

820
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,559
understanding and the results of their

821
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,679
actions

822
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,639
will not correspond to their

823
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:43,358
expectations

824
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,480
i call that the human uncertainty

825
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,838
principle

826
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,320
and i consider it a key feature of human

827
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:50,320
affairs

828
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,280
by contrast in the case of natural

829
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,719
phenomena

830
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,680
events unfold irrespective of the views

831
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,480
held by the observers the outside

832
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,879
observer

833
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,079
is engaged only in the cognitive

834
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,680
function

835
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,800
and the phenomena provide a reliable

836
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,598
criterion

837
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,519
by which the truth of the observer's

838
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,760
theories can be judged

839
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,639
so the outside observer can obtain

840
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,200
knowledge

841
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,519
based on that knowledge nature can be

842
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,239
successfully manipulated

843
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,280
there is a natural separation between

844
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,838
the cognitive

845
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,560
and manipulative function and due to

846
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,599
that

847
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,599
separation both functions can serve

848
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,200
their purpose better

849
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:43,440
than in the human sphere

850
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:46,799
at this point i need to

851
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,320
emphasize that reflexivity

852
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:54,160
is not the only source of uncertainty

853
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,400
in human affairs yes reflexivity does

854
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:59,118
introduce an element of uncertainty

855
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,639
both into the participants views and the

856
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,119
actual course of events

857
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,159
but other factors may also have the same

858
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,000
effect

859
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:10,239
for instance the fact that participants

860
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,039
can't know what the other participants

861
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:12,719
know

862
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,079
is something quite different from

863
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,199
reflexivity

864
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,240
yet it's a source of uncertainty the

865
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,480
fact

866
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,879
that different participants have

867
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,480
different interests some of which may be

868
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,960
in conflict with each other

869
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,159
is another source of uncertainty

870
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,880
moreover

871
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,598
each individual participant may be

872
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,640
guided

873
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,400
by a multiplicity of values which may

874
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,838
not be self-consistent

875
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,760
as isaiah berlin has pointed out

876
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,679
the uncertainties created by these

877
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,680
factors are likely to be

878
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:50,159
even more extensive than those generated

879
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,118
by reflexivity i have lumped them all

880
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,118
together

881
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,119
and and when i speak of the human

882
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,519
uncertainty principle

883
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:01,519
which is an even broader concept than

884
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:01,519
reflexivity

885
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,119
the human uncertainty principle i'm

886
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,400
talking about

887
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,838
is much more specific and stringent

888
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,880
than the subjective skepticism

889
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:20,480
that pervades cartesian philosophy

890
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,519
it gives an uh an objective reason to

891
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,800
believe

892
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:29,599
that our perceptions and expectations

893
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,599
are or at least maybe wrong

894
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,400
although the primary impact

895
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,920
of human uncertainty falls under

896
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,800
participants

897
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,960
it has far-reaching implications for the

898
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,000
social sciences

899
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,320
i can explicate them best by

900
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,320
invoking karl power's theory of

901
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,880
scientific method

902
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,838
it's a beautifully simple and elegant

903
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,119
scheme

904
00:38:53,838 --> 00:39:00,159
it consists of three elements and

905
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,440
three operations the three elements

906
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:06,239
are scientific laws and

907
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,039
the initial and final conditions to

908
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,399
which those

909
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:14,880
laws apply the three operations are

910
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,760
prediction explanation and testing

911
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,680
when the scientific laws are combined

912
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,160
with the initial conditions

913
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:22,960
they provide predictions when they are

914
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,759
combined

915
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,280
with the final conditions they provide

916
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,440
explanations

917
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,800
in this sense predictions and

918
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,720
explanations

919
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:38,240
are symmetrical and reversible

920
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:40,639
that leaves testing where predictions

921
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:45,199
derived from scientific laws

922
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:49,358
are compared with the actual results

923
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:52,480
according to popper scientific laws

924
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,639
are hypothetical in character they can't

925
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,920
be verified they can only be

926
00:39:54,639 --> 00:40:01,039
falsified by testing the key

927
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,920
to the success of scientific method is

928
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,679
that it can test generalizations of

929
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,200
universal validity

930
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:12,639
with the help of singular observations

931
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:15,919
one failed test is sufficient sufficient

932
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:19,279
to falsify a theory

933
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:23,760
but no amount of confirming instances is

934
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,880
sufficient to verify

935
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,280
this is a brilliant solution to the

936
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,039
otherwise intractable problem

937
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,640
how can science be both empirical

938
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:39,759
and rational according to popper

939
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,559
it's empirical because we test our

940
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,240
theories

941
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:47,519
by observing whether the the predictions

942
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,719
we derive from them are true and it's

943
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,000
rational

944
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:55,439
because we use deductive logic

945
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,559
in doing so papa dispenses

946
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,960
with inductive logic and relies instead

947
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,239
on

948
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,079
testing generalizations that

949
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:09,358
can't be tested do not qualify

950
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:14,240
as scientific papers

951
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,239
emphasis on the central role of testing

952
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,919
plays a very important role in

953
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,960
scientific method and

954
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,800
establishes a strong case for

955
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,838
critical thinking but by asserting that

956
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,560
scientific laws are only provisionally

957
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,400
valid

958
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:39,599
and remain open to re-examination

959
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,400
thus the three salient features of

960
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,440
papa's

961
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,838
scheme are the symmetry

962
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,000
between prediction and explanation the

963
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:53,599
asymmetry between verification

964
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,280
and falsification and the central role

965
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:02,480
of testing testing allows science

966
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:06,000
to grow improve and innovate

967
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,199
proper scheme works well for the study

968
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,838
of natural phenomena but the human

969
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,719
uncertainty principle throws a monkey

970
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,159
range

971
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:19,439
into the supreme simplicity and elegance

972
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:22,799
of papa's scheme the symmetry mat

973
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:26,318
at the symmetry between predictions

974
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,240
and explanations is destroyed because

975
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,679
of the element of uncertainty in

976
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,318
predictions

977
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:34,239
and the central role of testing is

978
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:37,679
endangered

979
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:41,039
should the initial and final conditions

980
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,078
include or exclude the participants

981
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,960
thinking

982
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,839
the question is important because

983
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,519
testing

984
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:52,719
requires replicating those conditions

985
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:54,960
if the participants thinking is included

986
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,439
it's difficult to observe what the

987
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,720
initial and final conditions are

988
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,920
because the participants views can only

989
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,879
be inferred

990
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,240
from their statements or actions if it's

991
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,240
excluded

992
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:13,679
the initial and final conclusions don't

993
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:16,479
constitute singular observations because

994
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,679
the same objective conditions may be

995
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,559
associated

996
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,919
with very different views held by the

997
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,440
participants

998
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,159
in either case generalizations can't be

999
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,760
properly

1000
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:32,639
tested these difficulties don't

1001
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,520
preclude social scientists from

1002
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,159
producing

1003
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,519
worthwhile generalizations but they are

1004
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:41,279
unlikely to meet

1005
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:44,400
the requirements of proper scheme nor

1006
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,200
can they match the predictive power of

1007
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:55,838
the laws

1008
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:55,838
of physics

1009
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,640
scientific social scientists have

1010
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,480
found this this conclusion hard to

1011
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:09,679
accept

1012
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,880
economists in particular suffer from

1013
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:14,159
what sigmund freud

1014
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,200
might call physics envy

1015
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,239
and there have been many attempts to

1016
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,719
eliminate

1017
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,799
the difficulties connected with the

1018
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:26,399
human uncertainty principle

1019
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,440
by in inventing or postulating

1020
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,000
some kind of fixed relationship

1021
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,240
between the participants thinking and

1022
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,079
the actual state of affairs

1023
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:39,279
karl marx asserted that the ideological

1024
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,039
superstructure

1025
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,359
was determined by the material

1026
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,400
conditions of production

1027
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:47,440
and freud maintained that people's

1028
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,559
behavior

1029
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,800
was determined determined by drives

1030
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,519
and complexes of which they were not

1031
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,519
even aware

1032
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:03,118
both claimed scientific status

1033
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,159
for their theories although as popper

1034
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,760
pointed out

1035
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:11,039
they can't be falsified by testing

1036
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,319
but by far the most impressive attempt

1037
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:18,400
has been mounted by economic theory

1038
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:19,679
it started out by assuming perfect

1039
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,838
knowledge

1040
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,679
and when that assumption turned out to

1041
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:25,920
be unsustainable

1042
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,199
it went through an increasing

1043
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,760
contortions

1044
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,199
to maintain the fiction of rational

1045
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,319
behavior

1046
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:37,679
economics ended up with the theory of

1047
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:40,159
rational expectations which maintains

1048
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,279
that there is a single optimum view of

1049
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:44,078
the future

1050
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,960
that which corresponds to it and

1051
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,039
eventually

1052
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,838
all the market participants will

1053
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:53,759
converge around that view

1054
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:57,039
this postulate is absurd but

1055
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,760
it is needed in order to allow economic

1056
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:02,800
theory

1057
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:06,000
to model itself on newtonian physics

1058
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,359
interestingly both karl popper and

1059
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,400
friedrich hire

1060
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:12,639
recognized in their famous exchange in

1061
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,240
the pages of economica

1062
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:20,318
that the social sciences can't produce

1063
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:23,519
results compared comparable to physics

1064
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:26,000
hayek invade against the mechanical

1065
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:28,159
and uncritical application of the

1066
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,440
quantitative methods of natural

1067
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:34,879
science he called it scientism

1068
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,559
and carl proper wrote about the poverty

1069
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,119
of historicism

1070
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,000
where he argued that history is not

1071
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,640
determined

1072
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,920
by universally valid scientific laws

1073
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,799
nevertheless popper proclaimed

1074
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,920
what he called the doctrine of the unity

1075
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,480
of method

1076
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,880
by which he meant that both natural and

1077
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:01,119
social sciences should be judged

1078
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:04,000
by the same criteria and hayek of course

1079
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,280
became the apostle of the chicago school

1080
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,119
of economics

1081
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:12,880
where market fundamentalism was born

1082
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,519
but as i see it the implication of the

1083
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,400
human

1084
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,239
uncertainty principle is that the

1085
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,880
subject matter of the natural

1086
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,759
and social sciences is fundamentally

1087
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,838
different

1088
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,079
therefore they need to develop different

1089
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:29,920
methods and they have to be held

1090
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:32,318
to different standards economic theory

1091
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,318
should not be expected to produce

1092
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:37,599
universally valid laws

1093
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:39,119
that can be used reversally to explain

1094
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,400
and predict historic

1095
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,800
events i contend that the slavish

1096
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,838
imitation of natural science

1097
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,280
inevitably leads to the distortion

1098
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,159
of human and social phenomena what is

1099
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,680
attainable

1100
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,960
in social science falls short of what is

1101
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,879
attainable

1102
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:04,480
in in in physics

1103
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,119
i am somewhat troubled however

1104
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,240
about drawing a sharp distinction

1105
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,680
between

1106
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:15,118
the naturals and social sciences

1107
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:16,239
such dichotomies are usually not found

1108
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,440
in reality

1109
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:22,479
they are introduced by us in our efforts

1110
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,559
to make some sense out of an otherwise

1111
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,920
confusing reality

1112
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:31,839
indeed while a sharp distinction

1113
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:35,599
between physics and social sciences

1114
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:38,880
seems justified there are other sciences

1115
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,079
such as biology than the study of animal

1116
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,119
societies

1117
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:49,920
that occupy intermediate position

1118
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:54,000
but i had to abandon my reservations

1119
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:57,440
and recognize a dichotomy because

1120
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,400
the social sciences encounter a

1121
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,358
second difficulty from which the natural

1122
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,480
sciences

1123
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:08,880
are exempt and that is

1124
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,639
that social theories are reflexive

1125
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,400
heisenberg's discovery of the

1126
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,598
uncertainty principle

1127
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,680
didn't alter the behavior of of quantum

1128
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,720
particles one iota

1129
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:23,519
but social theories whether marxism

1130
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,959
market fundamentalism or the theory of

1131
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,759
reflexivity

1132
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,599
can affect the subject matter to which

1133
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,800
it refers

1134
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,318
scientific method is supposed to be

1135
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:39,359
devoted to the pursuit of truth

1136
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:40,400
heisenberg's uncertainty principle does

1137
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:44,480
not interfere

1138
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:47,838
with that postulate but the reflexivity

1139
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,639
of social theories does

1140
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,000
why should social science science

1141
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,598
confine itself

1142
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,719
to passively studying social phenomena

1143
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:02,160
when it can be used to actively change

1144
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:05,358
the state of affairs as i

1145
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:07,679
remarked in the alchemy of finance our

1146
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:08,719
the the alchemy of finance the

1147
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,239
alchemists

1148
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:16,078
made a mistake in trying to change

1149
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:18,399
the nature of base metals by incantation

1150
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,119
instead they should have focused their

1151
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,358
attention

1152
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,400
on the financial markets where they

1153
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:24,400
could have succeeded

1154
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:32,880
how how could how could social science

1155
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:36,318
be protected against this interference

1156
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,960
i proposed a simple remedy recognize

1157
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:40,480
a dichotomy between the natural and

1158
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,000
social sciences

1159
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:46,559
this will ensure that social theories

1160
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,239
will be judged on their merits and not

1161
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,680
by a false analogy

1162
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:54,239
with natural science i propose this

1163
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,279
as a convention for the protection of

1164
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,558
scientific

1165
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,680
method not as a demotion or

1166
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,720
devaluation of social science the

1167
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:06,639
convention

1168
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:09,118
sets no limits on what social science

1169
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,159
may be able to accomplish on the

1170
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,559
contrary

1171
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,920
by liberating social science for the

1172
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,119
from the slavish

1173
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:20,159
imitation of natural science and

1174
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,200
protecting it from being judged

1175
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:26,639
by the wrong standards it should open up

1176
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,598
new vistas it's in this spirit that i

1177
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,480
shall

1178
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,519
put forward my interpretation of

1179
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,679
financial

1180
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:38,800
markets tomorrow i apologize

1181
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:42,159
for dwelling so long in the rarified

1182
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,359
realm of abstractions i promise to come

1183
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:51,838
down to earth

1184
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:51,838
in my next lecture tomorrow thank you

1185
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:01,920
you
