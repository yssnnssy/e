1
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,559
I hope we may be able to elaborate a

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,839
little bit more on this inet initiative

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,439
during the question and answer session

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,240
if any of you would like to uh ask some

5
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,358
questions about it uh but I wanted to

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,240
reflect in the uh seven or eight minutes

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,800
that I've been given on uh George's

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:27,320
broader ideas listening to George today

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,359
I was reminded of when we first met it

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,960
was in 1983 during the first of the

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,399
bubbles he mentioned the third world

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,719
debt crisis and was actually at the

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,719
annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,760
I was then a young journalist working

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,039
for the financial times and I just ran

16
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,359
into him by accident we were talking

17
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,000
about what it was that the IMF was doing

18
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:55,558
wrong in Mexico and Brazil at that time

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,759
but for me his ideas were really a

20
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,280
revelation perhaps because I was so

21
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:03,000
young at the time uh and we became

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,400
friends and I followed the development

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,879
of georg's ideas closely enough to feel

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,359
that I really understood them so that

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,679
when he published what I still think was

26
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,799
his most important book The Alchemy of

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Finance I felt like an initiate into a

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,400
secret religious sect uh not because I

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,200
worship George or indeed his ideas far

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,000
from it but because I was told at that

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,640
time by almost everybody I met the

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,438
Georgia's philosophy was totally

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,879
incomprehensible the reason people

34
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,199
bought that first book was because they

35
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:43,039
thought they would pick up some

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,359
investment tips yet I felt to me these

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,759
Concepts that he first described fully

38
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:52,159
in that book of and that he mentioned

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:56,519
today of reflexivity fallibility and

40
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,640
human uh uncertainty and particularly

41
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,560
the relationship between those three

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,319
concepts to me me those Concepts seemed

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,280
absolutely clear and

44
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,878
revelatory others as I said differed and

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,560
only bought the books for investment

46
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:16,079
tips but even though George was told

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,080
initially that his ideas were

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,120
incomprehensible he continued to explain

49
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,000
them with the combination of persistence

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,120
self-confidence and

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,280
self-criticism which has made him so

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,360
successful also as an investor and the

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,878
interesting thing now is that when he

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,160
talks about reflexivity as I think he

55
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:41,000
probably did most articulately in this

56
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:43,120
lecture now everybody in the markets

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,280
claims to understand reflexivity

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,400
perfectly in fact if they couldn't

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,199
understand it they would not be able to

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,039
uh continue in their jobs in the markets

61
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,039
uh and even in the policymaking world

62
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,318
among Central Bankers he mentioned mvin

63
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,799
King and finance ministers the idea that

64
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:05,518
the world goes through reflexive boombas

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,959
Cycles between finance and policy is now

66
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,080
pretty much accepted as the conventional

67
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,519
wisdom it's really only among academic

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,959
economists that this idea is not

69
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,640
recognized and perhaps although only

70
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,840
perhaps as George said uh the

71
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,919
development of inet will uh lead to um

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,120
its further uh it it its further

73
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,839
development but as reflexivity has now

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,599
become such Common Ground among

75
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,598
economists and policy makers all over

76
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:37,079
the world uh I want to put on uh if you

77
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:39,560
like my perverse my challenging hat and

78
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,040
actually disagree and challenge some of

79
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,280
the ideas that George put forward today

80
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:48,519
briefly uh the boomas sequences as

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,239
George said in his lecture can be

82
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,200
interrupted by government intervention

83
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,560
or other exogenous forces and the

84
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,399
question I want to raise is whether it's

85
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,039
possible that the world does in fact

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,000
tend into equilibrium despite what we've

87
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:08,840
just heard provided the periods are long

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,719
enough and not solely through the

89
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,920
operation of markets but through the

90
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,879
operation of markets interacting with

91
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,238
government if we take the role of

92
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,238
government into account is it possible

93
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,879
that the world does actually tend to

94
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,839
equilibrium orbe it going through fairly

95
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,639
large Cycles in a way this actually

96
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,399
relates to a theory that George first

97
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,000
discussed during that third world debt

98
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:37,120
crisis which he called the brink Theory

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,839
the idea that events push uh crisis to

100
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,478
the brink of complete chaos but not

101
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,758
quite over the brink and this is of

102
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,680
course a concept that's also uh been

103
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,639
developed in uh the mathematical theory

104
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,319
of complexity and Chaos where the world

105
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,280
is always or complex systems are always

106
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,599
said to be operating just on the edge of

107
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:02,079
chaos maybe the Super Bubble of finance

108
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,400
and regulation he uh he he's discussed

109
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,079
and indeed the even bigger Super Bubble

110
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:10,279
of Market fundamentalism and if you like

111
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:13,399
Keynesian Social Democratic politics is

112
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:16,279
not after all a bubble but in a sense a

113
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:19,478
process of evolution and maybe there is

114
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,599
an equilibrating mechanism are what

115
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:24,478
George called the brink Theory and what

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,520
might be called the mechanisms of polic

117
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,758
politics and democracy in other words

118
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,799
maybe there is an equilibrating

119
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,360
mechanism within politics which prevents

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,280
these boom bust Cycles in in Market

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,520
fundamentalism in economics going too

122
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:44,079
far George described how all bubbles are

123
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,959
created by a trend and a misconception

124
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,079
and it's absolutely clear that the

125
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,560
misconception not of just of the last

126
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,159
two or three years but really of the

127
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,759
last 20 years was as he said that

128
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,319
markets could totally replace politics

129
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,560
in ordering Human Society but maybe that

130
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,199
misconception is now going to be

131
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,800
corrected leading to the emergence if

132
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,038
you like of a new form of

133
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,360
capitalism and I think the key to this

134
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,879
new form of capitalism is it if it

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,560
emerges will in fact go back to

136
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:19,079
Georgia's three concepts of reflexivity

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,399
fallibility and human

138
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,318
uncertainty in my view we are perhaps

139
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,478
moving into a fourth phase of capitalism

140
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,960
if you like the first phase 19th century

141
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:30,399
capitalism was when politics and

142
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,879
economics were believed to be totally

143
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,279
distinct and both were believed to be

144
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,199
evolving in a generally constructive

145
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,198
Direction by the conventional wisdom or

146
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,199
were believed to be both doomed to

147
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,879
failure if you're a Marxist both

148
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,800
economics and politics would were

149
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,759
believed to be either constructive or

150
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,478
doomed to failure in the 1930s that

151
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,919
perception changed and from 1930s to the

152
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,159
70s we went through a phase when there

153
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,799
was a widespread belief that markets

154
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,800
were always prone to failure and social

155
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,000
injustice but governments were always

156
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,759
knowledgeable and just in other words

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,879
the market was always wrong the

158
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:12,120
government was always right in the 70s

159
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,280
there was another Revolution and from

160
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,840
1979 with the election of Margaret

161
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,038
Thatcher 1980 onwards we went through a

162
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,439
third stage in which the prevailing

163
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,918
belief if you like the prevailing

164
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,319
misconception was that markets were

165
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:28,478
always efficient and rational while

166
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,520
governments were always wrong now it

167
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,439
seems to me as a out of last year's

168
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:36,439
crisis we could be moving into a fourth

169
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,680
stage where it is recognized that both

170
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:43,000
markets and governments are fallible not

171
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,280
always fallible but frequently fallible

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,360
now the last point I'd like to make is a

173
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,279
more positive one which is that the

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,680
recognition of fallibility sounds

175
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:56,038
paralyzing but actually it can be

176
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,360
empowering fallibility and the

177
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,959
recognition the explicit recognition of

178
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,960
human uncertainty is George describes

179
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:08,439
creat space for change Innovation

180
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,318
creativity imagination and

181
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:16,158
Leadership and it forces

182
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:19,560
empiricism self-analysis and internal

183
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:23,839
self-correction and in my view nobody

184
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:27,158
has symbolized such creative con uh such

185
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:29,679
creative tension between fallibility and

186
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:32,360
confident self- knowledge both in his

187
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,000
business and his philosophical ideas as

188
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,000
George Soros thank you very

189
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:50,279
much if I may briefly uh respond before

190
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:55,720
with while people at the MIT prepar

191
00:08:50,278 --> 00:09:00,720
their questions uh uh you may be right

192
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:04,360
and and certainly if we take that step

193
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,879
forward and recognize that both markets

194
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,079
and governments are failable liable to

195
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,039
make mistakes and therefore willing to

196
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:17,039
correct their mistakes uh we are more

197
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:21,159
likely uh to actually uh develop a

198
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:25,639
system uh which does not uh end in a

199
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:28,120
financial crisis however if we made that

200
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:31,439
assumption uh that we have reached such

201
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,320
a system should surely there are the

202
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,640
seeds of the next financial crisis so

203
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,480
you have to

204
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:43,879
assume that you will not be able to do

205
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,159
it in order to achieve it and as you as

206
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:48,720
you

207
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:53,838
know we've actually really

208
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,440
extended the uh the financial cycle by

209
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,480
several decades through

210
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,680
intervention uh and so to that extent

211
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,320
interventions were really very

212
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:10,359
successful uh how however then they made

213
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:14,120
the bubble when it's the Super Bubble um

214
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:18,879
that much greater uh and the and the the

215
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,959
the great crisis of 20 crash of 2008 was

216
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:25,078
preceded by the great

217
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:28,559
moderation when you know risk uh

218
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:30,399
assessments were at at a minimum so

219
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:34,319
that's the

220
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,720
contradiction and that's the the kind of

221
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,200
awareness of reality that we need in

222
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:45,040
order to uh maintain

223
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,759
balance I would agree with you that the

224
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,039
the system can only continue if there is

225
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,759
a systemic change not just a marginal

226
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,278
change if there is a systemic change and

227
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,799
not just in finance but in the whole

228
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,639
relationship of markets and government

229
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,958
that's right now whether that happens or

230
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,039
not as you say very much remains to be

231
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,039
seen the jury's out and in fact perhaps

232
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,159
the evidence is becoming less favorable

233
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:12,519
to that point of view but actually I

234
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:17,000
will will address exactly that question

235
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:21,039
in in my last lecture uh shall We Now go

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,799
to MIT uh where uh we'll take the first

237
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,838
uh set of questions and then we'll move

238
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,399
to the audience here in Budapest uh do

239
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,880
we have uh a question uh to start with

240
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,919
from MIT

241
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:37,360
yes we have three questions prepare good

242
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:39,599
afternoon Mr Soros Mr ketki and CU

243
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,120
participants first

244
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,040
question yes we can hear could you talk

245
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,278
a bit a bit more slowly because uh then

246
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:50,000
we'll we'll hear more

247
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:52,519
clearly very good can you hear

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,879
me can you hear

249
00:11:52,519 --> 00:12:00,720
me okay I guess you can uh yes my name

250
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:03,000
is Mark I'm an alumnist of MIT

251
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,399
do we have we can't hear you have we

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,399
have we lost the sound we have lost the

253
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:11,958
sound for the moment pressure mic

254
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:15,480
again there we go yes um my name is Mark

255
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,919
lar I'm an alumnus of uh MIT and a

256
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,759
professor of management at suffk

257
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:23,278
University in Boston I'd like to thank

258
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:25,919
Mr Soros for a blast of fresh air and

259
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:29,439
unorthodox thinking uh I have a question

260
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,958
about the role of uh private incentives

261
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,480
and compensation incentives of top

262
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:36,799
managers as a possible um source of

263
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,680
distortion I'm wondering whether that's

264
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,719
a major or a minor factor in such crisis

265
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,679
and whether Mr s has some

266
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,320
recommendations about how to regulate

267
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,879
the uh compensation and incentives of

268
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,839
top

269
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:58,320
managers well I mentioned that

270
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,000
institutions uh that are too big to fail

271
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,519
have to submit

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,480
to government regulation of

273
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:12,639
salaries and there is at the moment some

274
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:16,278
serious um I would say

275
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,198
social injustice in the very large

276
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:21,519
bonuses that people in those

277
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:25,679
institutions earn

278
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:31,159
because the earnings currently are due

279
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:34,958
to a hidden subsidy that the banks are

280
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:38,120
receiving by keeping interest rates at

281
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,559
zero and allowing them to invest for

282
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,799
instance in government bonds 10year

283
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:47,679
bonds yielding 3 and a half% that's 3

284
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:52,319
and a half% free and clear hidden

285
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:55,919
subsidy this is the route that we have

286
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,759
chosen following the the Japanese

287
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:04,078
example uh to allow the banks to earn

288
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:07,240
their way out of a hole and I think for

289
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:11,278
the employees of the banks to then get

290
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:14,278
an extra bonus on that money actually is

291
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,278
socially

292
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,879
unacceptable another question from

293
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:28,078
MIT hello my name is am kalar I'm a

294
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,120
Sloan MBA student and I want to thank

295
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,638
you first for having this talk with us

296
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,278
um can you please share your views on

297
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,039
the comments made yesterday by Professor

298
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:42,320
rubini about the status of the US Dollar

299
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,599
carry trades and the consequences which

300
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
may arise when these positions will

301
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,000
unfold and do you think we're

302
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,879
experiencing a a new bubble evolving

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,198
thank

304
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,799
you uh I didn't actually read those

305
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:02,120
those comments so I don't know what you

306
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:04,639
are uh referring referring to but uh

307
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,959
certainly there are

308
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,959
currently uh

309
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:16,679
imbalances uh uh in uh the financial

310
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:19,719
system uh due to the uh quantitative

311
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:23,319
easing and the

312
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,800
availability of free financing so that

313
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,600
is actually for the moment uh to the

314
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:34,120
extent that the stimulus is applied in

315
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:40,199
the United States which uh really would

316
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:43,000
need to reduce its Uh current account uh

317
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:48,399
deficit uh the stimulus is applied in

318
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:52,318
the wrong place and is building up the

319
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,159
imbalances which were partially uh

320
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,479
responsible for the crisis in what sense

321
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:00,759
do you mean it's being applied in the

322
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,240
wrong place the stimulus well because to

323
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:06,199
to balance the world

324
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,039
economy the United States has been

325
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:12,318
consuming significantly more 6 and a

326
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:17,439
half% more at the end uh than it was

327
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:20,120
producing and that built up the the um

328
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,279
surpluses in the uh in the other

329
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:26,560
countries that uh uh and which were then

330
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:29,639
in invested in US government bonds and

331
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:32,638
that was uh sort of at the root root of

332
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,240
the great moderation that preceded the

333
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,198
storm that's what I mean MH so you're

334
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,039
saying the stimulus it would be better

335
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,198
if more stimulus were applied in other

336
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,958
countries in the in the exporting

337
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,039
countries and the in the Surplus

338
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,198
countries yes and then particularly in

339
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:51,639
the developing world and as you know I'm

340
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:54,198
advocating uh the re the use of the

341
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,198
special drawing rights uh for the

342
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:59,399
developing world but that would take us

343
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:01,359
too far here do we have another question

344
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,480
from

345
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:09,199
MIT hi my name is Fernando DTE and I am

346
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:13,400
a PhD candidate at MIT and my question

347
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,160
is in terms of predictability of returns

348
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,360
what are the different

349
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,279
implications between the efficient

350
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,838
markets hypothesis and

351
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:26,318
reflexivity the what in terms of the pr

352
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:30,519
predictability of the crisis and of the

353
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:33,798
cycle uh where were the where were the

354
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:35,720
specific different points between an

355
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:38,079
efficient market analysis and the

356
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,679
reflexivity analysis which in a sense

357
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:43,399
would allow you to see you know which

358
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,840
analysis was empirically better well you

359
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,880
know I'm not qualified to to criticize

360
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:52,798
the efficient market hypothesis and the

361
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,200
rational expectations Theory directly

362
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,599
because I'm not familiar with it the

363
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,400
fact that I

364
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:02,959
was uh able to make a living for last 50

365
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,080
years without being familiar with it is

366
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:12,480
a comment on the value of that uh of

367
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:17,599
those however um uh I I can tell you

368
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:21,599
that my uh interpretation of bubbles

369
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:25,079
expressly doeses not claim to be able to

370
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:28,839
tell whether a test will be successful

371
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:31,439
or not and from personal experience I

372
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,240
thought the Super Bubble was big enough

373
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,640
in

374
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,359
98 that it would lead to a collapse of

375
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:43,919
the financial system and I was wrong so

376
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:46,519
I do not claim to be able to predict uh

377
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:51,880
the future and I expressly claim the

378
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:55,720
opposite however I think that with that

379
00:18:51,880 --> 00:19:01,720
theory it is possible to anticipate

380
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:04,240
events to uh create uh scenarios and

381
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,640
hypotheses that you can then test

382
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,120
against the actual course of events and

383
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:14,240
that is in fact what I have been doing

384
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:17,519
for the last uh 50 years as a market

385
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,079
participants a participant whenever I

386
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,839
could I formulated a hypothesis uh with

387
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:25,399
regard to a particular stock or the

388
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:29,519
market or an

389
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:33,480
industry um and then I tested it against

390
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:37,200
events and when events uh evolve

391
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:40,880
differently I reassessed it uh so I

392
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,000
think this and this is a very paparian

393
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,600
approach and that's why I'm a great

394
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,759
admirer of of Papa's uh uh theory of

395
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:54,199
scientific method uh even though he

396
00:19:50,759 --> 00:20:01,158
doesn't apply the way he he he wants it

397
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:04,679
to uh to social phena uh because of this

398
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,720
Reliance on conjectures and

399
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:10,919
reputations uh and it it's been a very

400
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,600
very rewarding process as far as I'm

401
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,400
concerned well well let me press you a

402
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,719
little bit further on that uh to give a

403
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,240
specific example if we look at this

404
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,038
latest crisis and I think this was

405
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,839
really the question that was being asked

406
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:27,759
if we look at this latest crisis uh

407
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:30,959
could you describe for us at what point

408
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:34,079
you began to uh develop if you like

409
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,038
these hypoth a hypothesis suggesting to

410
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:41,240
you that we may be moving

411
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,558
into into a climax of a a major bubble

412
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,759
or perhaps even the Super Bubble and you

413
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,798
know what were some of the events that

414
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,240
led you either to confirm or uh draw

415
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,480
back from that

416
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,960
hypothesis that we may be that was clear

417
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,720
to me obviously for many years and and I

418
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,079
in in my my previous book in

419
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:09,159
2006 I spelled it out and I identified

420
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:14,480
actually uh the the subp and the housing

421
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:17,840
U Market as the locus from which the the

422
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,960
uh crisis would come so that was and I

423
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:24,480
was not the only one who who did that uh

424
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,798
so it was visible but when it would come

425
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,640
was could not be determined and frankly

426
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:33,278
I and many others who expected it to

427
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,799
happen expected it to happen at least a

428
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:44,159
year earlier uh then it really started

429
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:49,558
to hit uh in the early part of uh of uh

430
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:53,200
2007 and in August two and I I wrote

431
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:57,359
about it uh then and published it that

432
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,840
was the new paradigm uh which I wrote

433
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:05,759
actually at Christmas

434
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:10,798
2006 um um published in in in April um

435
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:12,679
and then in August I saw that this the

436
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:16,558
crisis has really

437
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:20,159
arrived and I came out of retirement and

438
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:25,960
took over the management of my fund uh

439
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:29,278
in order to uh protect my my um estate

440
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:33,079
um which I did in in August so from

441
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:36,839
August uh 2007 it was pretty clear to

442
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:40,519
you that this was going to be a major

443
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:43,079
the major uh financial crisis not just

444
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:45,240
another minor bubble of the kind that

445
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:49,240
we've seen over the last 20 years yes

446
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:53,599
but to for for the order of

447
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,960
uh being being truthful I did not

448
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:59,519
anticipate that Leeman brothers would be

449
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:03,319
allowed to fail I I saw the crisis as

450
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:06,119
being the turning point but I did not

451
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:09,278
anticipate that the authorities would

452
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:13,239
fail to rescue Leman brothers and I

453
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:15,480
think that was a gamechanging event do

454
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,640
you think I'm sorry to take the time of

455
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,759
of our friends at MIT but on on that

456
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,880
point of Leman Brothers do you think the

457
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,839
authorities had any real

458
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,880
alternative I I think they did although

459
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:31,278
they would say that they did not have

460
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:34,120
the powers uh of resolution to intervene

461
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:36,880
but in actual fact Whenever there is a

462
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:39,719
crisis and the authorities recognize it

463
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,080
that recognize it as such they took

464
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,640
measures or in historically which could

465
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:49,000
not be justified by the then prevailing

466
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:52,480
rules so they always uh used a large

467
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,519
degree of discretion and they could have

468
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,159
done it had

469
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:00,839
they been determined to do so another

470
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,840
question from

471
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:08,119
MIT this is Ricardo cavero head of the

472
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:11,079
economics Department of MIT good

473
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:14,199
afternoon Mr Soros um you mentioned the

474
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:16,558
the need to control credit uh in order

475
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,798
to regulate asset Bubbles and you

476
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,158
mentioned the example of China um but

477
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,240
the big difference between China and the

478
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,480
US is the type of financial markets they

479
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,880
have and we have in in China it's mostly

480
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,759
Bank Med credit most mostly Bank

481
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,360
mediated the same is true in Continental

482
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:35,200
Europe but in the US Banks play a very

483
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,599
small role so what do you do in a more

484
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,038
complex Financial market like the US in

485
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,678
order to control credit when asset

486
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,398
bubble is

487
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,120
developing I I I'm I'm sorry Professor

488
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:48,759
cabalero the the the sound transmission

489
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,519
was not very clear I think I understood

490
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:53,558
the question but uh come back if I've

491
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:56,679
misinterpreted uh I think the question

492
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:58,918
was that uh you mentioned that there's

493
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,919
going to be a need to control credit as

494
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,720
well as use monetary policy to regulate

495
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,600
Bubbles and you gave China as an example

496
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,720
of the successful control of credit uh I

497
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:11,119
think the question was that in China

498
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,558
it's possible to control credit because

499
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,639
they have uh a dominant banking system

500
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,798
and almost no credit markets and indeed

501
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,278
the the banking system is largely State

502
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:24,319
controlled if you if you have a system

503
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:27,720
like the US which is largely a credit

504
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:30,558
market securitized system is there any

505
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,120
feasible way of actually exercising

506
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,599
control over credit I think that was the

507
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:40,839
question yes I think there is and in

508
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:44,038
fact that control was being exercised as

509
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:48,319
I've mentioned in my lecture when I

510
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:53,119
started in business banking system was

511
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:56,079
extremely closely controlled and I I've

512
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,839
actually witnessed and participated in

513
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:03,240
the gradual decontrol

514
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:05,720
of the finance of the banking system in

515
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:11,000
1972 I wrote

516
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:14,480
a paper uh entitled the case for for

517
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,440
growth Banks because I said that an

518
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:23,519
industry that was totally dormant and

519
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:26,278
the people uh working in it were not

520
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,639
motivated by profit motive but were more

521
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:32,759
like more like government and employees

522
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,960
H there was a new group of banks

523
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:41,119
actually very much under the leadership

524
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:44,200
of Walter wristen of City Bank um and

525
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:47,000
they fanned out from City Bank and and

526
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,558
they actually wanted to do banking for

527
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,319
profit and uh and I said this could be

528
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,639
very rewarding uh for investment and in

529
00:26:53,319 --> 00:27:02,000
fact it was uh and then in

530
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:05,520
73 it came the the oil crisis and the

531
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,919
large um surpluses that the oil

532
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:13,158
producing countries uh um uh received

533
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,320
which were then rechanneled through the

534
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:19,399
commercial Banks and that's when the

535
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:25,319
London Market the euro dollar market

536
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:28,558
suddenly came to life and gradually U

537
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:33,960
the very strict controls on on State

538
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:38,319
banking were were overcome by setting up

539
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:41,399
a London subsidiary that was exempt and

540
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:45,240
that then eventually led to the

541
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:49,000
financial crisis of 82 and so on so it

542
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,759
it is a historic process and I actually

543
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,798
have lived through the entire history

544
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,519
but is it possible now that the genie

545
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:58,599
has been let out of the bottle now that

546
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,919
you have a credit market system as

547
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,798
opposed to or a capital market system of

548
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,840
credit rather than a banking system of

549
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:07,480
credit in the US can you control credit

550
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,240
when it's supplied by the capital

551
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:14,720
markets well o o obviously you can't

552
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,880
control it as if if it were uh uh within

553
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,919
the banking system and actually what

554
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,480
happened was in

555
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:24,840
1982 as you recall because that's when

556
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,360
we first started discussing these issues

557
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:32,038
uh um the banks were forced by by the

558
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:35,199
central banks to renew roll over the

559
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:37,480
credits in order to prevent a collapse

560
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,519
and they didn't like it and that's

561
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,919
actually when they started securitizing

562
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:47,120
their loans uh so that they couldn't be

563
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,200
caught by the central banks in case of

564
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:53,918
need and then in

565
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,798
97 most of the Sovereign uh bonds had

566
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,600
been securitized and therefore actually

567
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,879
except in the case of Kore

568
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:05,918
South Korea uh the the banks could not

569
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:09,480
be uh forced to roll over the the loans

570
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:13,200
and that's why the brunt of the burden

571
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:17,079
was carried by the countries concerned

572
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,600
uh so uh it is more difficult if you

573
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,879
don't have it in the banking system but

574
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,678
I think that the measures that I

575
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,120
proposed and I think they need to be

576
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,880
further elaborated and and and refined

577
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,798
uh could actually

578
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,880
give you that kind of the control that

579
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,798
you that you need should we have one

580
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,480
more question from MIT and then we'll go

581
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:41,519
to the floor here and why don't we maybe

582
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,599
take take hang around unless there's

583
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,319
somebody dying at MIT we we'll have some

584
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:49,359
question I think there's someone about

585
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,359
to ask a question okay yeah last

586
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:55,000
question good afternoon Mr sorus I have

587
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,159
a question uh I'm a second year student

588
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,038
at MIT SLO and I want to carry on a

589
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:00,039
point about China

590
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,839
it's

591
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,278
on good afternoon Mr s I'm a second year

592
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,278
SL student to carry on with the point of

593
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,798
China it is able to control Capital

594
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:14,240
inflows due to its dominant economic

595
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,960
position in the

596
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,359
world how about a middle developing

597
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,558
country how does it do likewise one

598
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,678
example I think of is Malaysia which

599
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:27,359
closed up its its capital inflow borders

600
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,759
after 1998 crisis how does a developing

601
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:32,959
country like that

602
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:35,558
stand withstand International Capital

603
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,960
inflows uh I think the the question is

604
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:40,599
again uh apologies but it didn't come

605
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,720
through very clearly but uh I think the

606
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:47,240
question was about Capital controls and

607
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:51,038
the disruptive inflows and outflows of

608
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,880
capital uh China has Capital controls

609
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,960
even despite the fact that it's an

610
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,480
overwhelming now an overwhelmingly

611
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,399
powerful economy uh I think the question

612
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:03,319
was how how can other developing

613
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,959
countries other emerging economies uh

614
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,319
which are smaller and potentially more

615
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,399
vulnerable how should they cope with the

616
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:13,000
uh problem or the threat of disruptive

617
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:16,599
Capital flows yeah well it is much

618
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,398
easier to control Capital flows when

619
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:22,759
they are coming in than it is when

620
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:26,719
they're going out uh and you can see

621
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:32,919
that Brazil just imposed a

622
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:36,960
2% tax tax on all new Financial Capital

623
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:41,399
coming into Brazil in order to slow down

624
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:45,919
the inflow now that's a bit cruder than

625
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:52,199
the more sophisticated method that Chile

626
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:55,038
uh applies which uh apportions the the

627
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:59,919
uh the tax to the length of time that

628
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:03,480
the capital is is is committed uh uh but

629
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:07,480
and probably it will not slow it will

630
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:12,000
slow the inflow but probably will not uh

631
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:16,200
uh stop it uh but clearly there is a

632
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,200
greater role for Capital controls then

633
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:26,759
the Washington consensus recognized uh

634
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:28,319
prior uh to the the crisis now China has

635
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:34,000
actually

636
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:37,119
uh discovered a fabulous

637
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,599
machine uh for

638
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:44,158
mobilizing the creative and and

639
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:49,359
acquisitive uh energies of the people

640
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:52,120
and and yet uh uh creaming off a

641
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,558
significant portion of their

642
00:32:52,119 --> 00:33:00,038
productivity for the benefit of the

643
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:03,440
state by tying the rembi to the dollar

644
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:04,798
and and effectively ensuring that the

645
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,519
Remi is

646
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:12,519
undervalued so that China has built up

647
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:15,440
the the amount of money that has been

648
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:18,759
creamed off without people feeling any

649
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,960
pain uh can be measured it's $2.3

650
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:25,839
trillion dollar and still

651
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,480
growing very good answer should we have

652
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,079
some questions here maybe we come back

653
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,759
to the yeah we we may come back uh if

654
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:36,079
there's time uh there's a question there

655
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:40,000
in the middle let's start with

656
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,798
that um hi yes um my name is Zan Gluk I

657
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,720
uh studied philosophy at Bard and now

658
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:46,918
I'm at the sociology Department here at

659
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,440
CU um I have two related questions I'll

660
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:53,320
try and make them brief um about the

661
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,200
nature of capitalism um one of them is

662
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:57,319
about economic theory and the other one

663
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,440
could I could say about uh Phil

664
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:01,558
philanthropy

665
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,600
practice um it seems that what you're

666
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:08,320
proposing here is a uh a theory of

667
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:11,319
crisis of sorts uh of financial capital

668
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,599
and I wanted to ask about um a broader

669
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,639
field of economic theory um crisis

670
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,440
Theory more generally and related to a

671
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,079
point brought up by Joseph stiglet in

672
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,079
his um lecture last week at CU um namely

673
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:28,720
that the postwar period we saw a 15

674
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,599
years of uh relative stability where

675
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,398
there were no um crises of capitalism

676
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,039
and that was a bit of an anomaly within

677
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:39,078
the history of capitalism I was

678
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:41,800
wondering how your uh Theory would apply

679
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:44,039
more broadly historically to say the

680
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,720
early capitalist crisis of the 19th

681
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:50,320
century

682
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:52,878
um and secondly just don't go second

683
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,879
because I missed the key key words so I

684
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:58,078
couldn't understand the question uh the

685
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,440
the the question is uh you have theory

686
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,760
of crisis of capitalism of financial

687
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:07,760
crisis uh can you relate it not just to

688
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,079
the crisis of the last 20 or 30 years uh

689
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,320
but going further back into into history

690
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,400
into the history of 19th century of

691
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,519
capitalism uh does your theory in some

692
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,079
sense still apply yeah yes the the big

693
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,480
difference that in the 19th century ever

694
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,800
since You' have had Financial PR uh uh

695
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,000
markets you have had financial crisis uh

696
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:34,039
in fact even when you only had two lip

697
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,519
markets you had financial crisis but but

698
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:39,960
each time there was a crisis there was

699
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:45,079
an attempt to understand what went wrong

700
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:48,280
and to uh bring some regulatory reform

701
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:50,240
and as I read the history of the 19th

702
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,280
century there were all kinds of

703
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:56,559
commissions in England examining after

704
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,359
each financial crisis what went wrong

705
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:04,239
and a step further was taken to build up

706
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:09,318
Central Banking and in the 20th century

707
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:13,039
uh after the after 19 29 uh you started

708
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:18,400
with the regulation of uh uh stock

709
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:23,079
markets uh so uh crisis were followed by

710
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:26,240
reforms whereas starting in 1980 because

711
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:29,280
of predominance of Market

712
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,598
fundamentalism uh crisis were followed

713
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,680
by

714
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:37,160
deregulation partly actually for very

715
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:40,078
practical reasons because in 19 after

716
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:43,399
1982 the banks also had to earn their

717
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:46,280
way out of the hole and it took them

718
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,519
about three to five years to do it

719
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:53,400
before eventually uh the uh Emerging

720
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:56,280
Market debt was reorganized into Brady

721
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,920
bonds uh so there was a practical reason

722
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,839
for doing it but there was also this

723
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:06,200
this um uh uh let's say ideological

724
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:08,480
reason and don't forget that glass

725
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:12,239
deagle was abolished only a few years

726
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,480
ago and and and uh short selling on the

727
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:19,078
stock exchange was the was abolished

728
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,838
only just in time uh for

729
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,200
bares yes there was a qu I think I had

730
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:25,799
the second question do you want to

731
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:29,480
briefly the second question very very

732
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,039
brief um uh it's it's related um and

733
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,880
perhaps could be related also to this

734
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,480
new economic Institute you're talking

735
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,318
about so about philanthropic

736
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,800
philanthropic practice um whether uh

737
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:45,838
philanthropy in your opinion um changes

738
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:49,640
the nature of capitalism um that is to

739
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:52,000
say um some critics have said that um

740
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:53,799
philanthropy sometimes acts as a

741
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,800
Band-Aid as what you've said is a

742
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,480
fundamentally broken system um and I was

743
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,560
wondering what you see the role of

744
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,280
philanthropy as whether or not it can

745
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:06,719
affect a deep structural change within

746
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,640
capitalism or whether you see it as some

747
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:12,879
type of a transition to uh a different

748
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:15,118
type of uh systemic solution to some of

749
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,318
the problems we've been

750
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,720
experiencing yes I I I do think and I

751
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:25,719
will deal with that issue uh uh

752
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,879
particularly in in the in the last

753
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:31,919
lecture uh where I deal with the

754
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:36,720
international aspects uh because uh

755
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:40,960
there U the system was supposed to to uh

756
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:44,239
to be uh a sort of a a Level Playing

757
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:48,720
Field but of but in fact the playing the

758
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:51,279
playing field was not level and and the

759
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:54,159
the center particularly the United

760
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:59,040
States was more equal than

761
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:03,519
others uh and and that brought about

762
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:06,679
certain imbalances which were very much

763
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:09,719
an element in the Super Bubble which I

764
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:12,519
didn't have time today to deal with but

765
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:13,559
I will uh deal with it in my fifth and

766
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,519
my last

767
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:18,199
lecture let question there and then one

768
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:19,800
there and then one no no no we'll have

769
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,439
this one and then you uh my name is

770
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,480
Peter Mi am from the economics

771
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,838
Department of the CU and in light of

772
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,559
your last words might be uh my question

773
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:32,440
is a little bit premature uh because you

774
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:34,480
uh promised what to speak uh later on uh

775
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,440
but I saw an interesting contrast

776
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,960
between your lecture and the the

777
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,079
subjects and the questions of the after

778
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,720
of the discussion after that people were

779
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,119
asking you about China in Malaysia and

780
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,480
other things so the international aspect

781
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,079
uh can we formulate the problem in uh in

782
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:58,159
in this language because what you

783
00:39:53,079 --> 00:40:00,318
presented was basically a a uh a a

784
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,799
crisis uh

785
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:04,519
recurring according to the rules of the

786
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,960
international financial markets

787
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:09,199
according to the rule of the American

788
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,400
markets but maybe actually and in in the

789
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:16,279
last uh event it is certainly the case

790
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,920
that uh the the bubble was created by

791
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,240
real

792
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,800
differences on the globe uh the

793
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,799
difference where China is relative to

794
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,240
United States difference where India is

795
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:32,280
relative to United States so so it's not

796
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:34,159
uh a a rule problem it's it's a

797
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,079
complexity of the world it's

798
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:40,480
globalization where countries having

799
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,960
really different situations uh play the

800
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,400
game on the international context and

801
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,318
because of the uh communication these

802
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,160
things go very very fast uh don't you

803
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:54,519
think that uh these are probably as

804
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:57,879
important element of the story the real

805
00:40:54,519 --> 00:41:00,679
differences and just uh a quick

806
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,960
reference to to the consequences I think

807
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,039
it was two days ago where uh Krugman in

808
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,079
the New York Times was talking about the

809
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,440
the Chinese currency problem very much

810
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:13,280
in the context as you do uh and then he

811
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,760
said China was stealing jobs from

812
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,640
elsewhere now this is real thing this is

813
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,960
not speculation and we cannot blame I

814
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,559
think from here or from anywhere else

815
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,960
that the Chinese government is pursuing

816
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:28,559
such a policy it's not speculation it's

817
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,199
not stupidity it's their interest

818
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:34,279
um yes there is obviously an

819
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:39,039
international aspect to it but let's

820
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:43,119
face it this particular crisis in 20072

821
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:45,480
2008 it originated at the center you see

822
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,480
and and therefore for this particular

823
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,318
phase of the crisis that issue is not

824
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:55,639
Central that's why I didn't deal with it

825
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:58,960
today I will deal with it uh fifth uh

826
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:01,400
lecture uh but if it is a very

827
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,119
definitely and I think that the

828
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,960
International System has to be rebuilt

829
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,680
uh I will I I don't want to go into my

830
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,838
fifth lecture now so bear with me until

831
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:14,759
then now there's a question over there

832
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:16,279
now there's a Forest of Hands going up

833
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,839
lots of people want to ask questions so

834
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,640
can we keep the questions question and I

835
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,599
would like to ask don't you think that

836
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,558
uh Regulators will be forced to ease

837
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:28,440
regulations at times of growth and this

838
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:30,920
is just a part of uh natural cycle that

839
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,159
regulations happen after such a crisis

840
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:37,960
and then as Market grow Regulators are

841
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:40,318
forced by politial political pressure to

842
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:44,440
ease uh Market regulations that

843
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:47,480
contribute later to the question is that

844
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,240
uh once the crisis subsides actually

845
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,159
Regulators will be forced to ease

846
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:54,879
regulation by political pressures uh so

847
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:56,719
even if there is a slight increase in

848
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,039
regulation in the immediate response to

849
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,480
the crisis

850
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,000
uh an easing in the long run is likely

851
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,639
well there already

852
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,920
is a desire to uh uh uh forget about

853
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:13,239
regulations because the the the the the

854
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,200
uh institutions that survived actually

855
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:19,000
their uh Market position has been

856
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:21,598
greatly strengthened and and therefore

857
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,960
they certainly tried to protect it with

858
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,039
all they have got and they've got plenty

859
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:33,960
so uh uh you will have a serious

860
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:37,960
issue uh and uh I just hope that we will

861
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:42,800
not forget uh about the reforms that are

862
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:45,880
needed uh because uh I I think that the

863
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,920
system has been very seriously weakened

864
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:53,640
and if you you put Humpty Dumpty

865
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:58,079
together again it will not

866
00:43:53,639 --> 00:44:01,358
last uh question over there

867
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,839
and maybe another one after thank you

868
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:07,119
good afternoon Mr

869
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:09,199
shash writers Al also PhD candidate

870
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,480
myself actually can you slow down it's

871
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:16,000
hard to answer so THS and writers um and

872
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,400
PhD candidate bnab Edge my question

873
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,519
would relate mainly to the last question

874
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,838
of MIT emerging markets and Bubbles um

875
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:28,400
are you not concerned that actually a

876
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:31,159
new uh bubble is uh formulating in the

877
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,400
Emerging Markets let's say with the

878
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:37,159
words of yours um fed by the positive

879
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,119
feedbacks of the increasing commodity

880
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:42,558
prices um the belief that these

881
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,358
countries has a greater potential and

882
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,839
the carry trade operations yeah thank

883
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,239
you the question was about Emerging

884
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,039
Markets don't you think that a new

885
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:54,558
bubble is is is coming along in Emerging

886
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:56,800
Markets fueled by misconceptions like

887
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,519
commodity prices will go up forever

888
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,160
these these countries have far better

889
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:03,800
prospects you know the the rise of China

890
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:09,199
and so on I don't think that everything

891
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:12,359
is a bubble and I do think that that um

892
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:15,679
uh this financial crisis which

893
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:19,358
originated at the center has hurt the

894
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:24,759
center much more than the than the

895
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:28,239
periphery and and uh uh I I do expect

896
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:32,240
the Emerging Markets to do significantly

897
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:34,719
better uh than than uh than the United

898
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:34,719
States

899
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:39,159
economy there was a question

900
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:45,399
there good afternoon Peter

901
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,920
grumberg do you think there's scope for

902
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,760
applying some aspects of sharia law or

903
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,519
ethical banking uh particularly with uh

904
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,480
reference to provision of credit and

905
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:58,079
debt

906
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,440
Finance sh law Sharia

907
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,119
banking Islamic banking I I don't know

908
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,559
much about it I'm sorry or ethical

909
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:10,079
banking is is is there an ethical

910
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:12,240
Dimension to banking that that could be

911
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,720
somehow brought back would that be a way

912
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:18,159
of controlling the banks by telling them

913
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:21,439
to be more virtuous yeah no look I'm a

914
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:24,000
great promoter of ethical values but I

915
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,358
don't see the application in this in

916
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,920
this context and I I the impression that

917
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:34,519
I have but I really don't take this as a

918
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:38,720
Ser well considered opinion

919
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:41,639
that the Islamic banking kind of

920
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:45,679
reconciles the Islamic rules with

921
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:48,799
banking through subterfuge where using

922
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:52,318
some other techniques

923
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,839
to find a

924
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,599
compromise uh there's a couple questions

925
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:58,838
here in the middle and then one there

926
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,838
thank you

927
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,000
um I'm L leasi from City Bank and amcham

928
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,760
so I'm one of those hated

929
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,880
Bankers um I just wanted to ask how why

930
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:16,200
is it in your opinion uh Dr shes that so

931
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,318
little analysis is being done about the

932
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:20,399
culpability of

933
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:23,880
interventions like The Fanny May and

934
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,079
Freddy ma to enable some of these things

935
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,440
to to proceed this is probably the only

936
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,880
time when the people who didn't pay back

937
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,280
the money are the good guys and the ones

938
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,119
that didn't get it back are the bad guys

939
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,880
and uh I might be biased obviously in

940
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:41,119
that the question is and and the

941
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,960
gentleman works for City Bank so take

942
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,200
that into account uh the question is uh

943
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,318
why has so little analysis been done of

944
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,078
the culpability of government

945
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:54,400
intervention in in creating this crisis

946
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,160
and the main example being Fanny May and

947
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,440
Freddy Mack you know they were supported

948
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,639
by the government uh they encouraged

949
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,838
lending to subprime borrowers and so on

950
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:06,400
and this is the first crisis in which

951
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:09,440
the people who didn't pay back the debt

952
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,280
don't seem to um bear any moral

953
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:15,480
responsibility but actually I certainly

954
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:19,280
am un record uh uh blaming The

955
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:22,719
Regulators for failing to regulate I

956
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,640
mean that was perhaps the the major

957
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,318
failure that doesn't exempt the banks

958
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:31,199
but it certainly

959
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:36,519
uh uh uh Regulators were as much at

960
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:39,679
fault in in in in uh uh uh failing to

961
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:43,000
perform their duties as the banks were

962
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,239
in in exceeding their U mandate but if

963
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,639
if I could I I'd like to press you a bit

964
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:49,719
on this because actually the this is a

965
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:51,199
point of view that's presented a lot in

966
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:53,919
the Wall Street Journal by the

967
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,358
Republican Party in the US that actually

968
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,400
this whole crisis was caused by the fact

969
00:48:56,358 --> 00:49:01,798
that markets were not free enough it was

970
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:06,599
the fact that governments intervened in

971
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:08,440
markets subsidized uh Home Loans to uh

972
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,240
you know poor households who wouldn't re

973
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,720
couldn't repay that actually caused the

974
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,519
crisis what's your reaction to that

975
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:18,439
argument it I think it's it's it's very

976
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:21,079
simple if you didn't have regulations

977
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,920
you Pro you wouldn't have sophisticated

978
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,318
financial markets because they would

979
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,680
have collapsed long ago I mean they

980
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:29,639
didn't collapse in '98

981
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:32,480
when there was plenty of reason for it

982
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:37,440
to to collapse because The Regulators

983
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:39,719
intervened successfully so uh to to to

984
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,000
argue that if you had no

985
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:45,558
regulations uh you would have no

986
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,400
crises I would say you also would have

987
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:48,400
no financial

988
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:54,919
markets okay

989
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:57,199
uh good afternoon Mr shos I'm Stuart

990
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,798
Durrant managing director of the ceu

991
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:02,358
business school and I'd like to pick up

992
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:05,318
on the issue which you raised of hidden

993
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:07,480
subsidies in Banks uh reported in the

994
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:09,000
times yesterday I think no surprise

995
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,280
there

996
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,599
um you make the point that the banks are

997
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,519
currently taking advantage of a window

998
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:20,400
of opportunity able to earn their way

999
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:23,639
out of a Hole by borrowing very cheaply

1000
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,318
and investing in government bonds at 3

1001
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:29,039
three and a half% or something what has

1002
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,400
made is possible was to a large extent

1003
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:34,759
the implementation of the quantitative

1004
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,760
easing programs and at least the way it

1005
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,599
was presented to me was that these

1006
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,880
programs were introduced in order to

1007
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:44,798
make government bonds less attractive to

1008
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:49,440
Banks and to promote the spread of

1009
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:52,119
credit into the economy is QE a failure

1010
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,480
or do we need to try harder uh the

1011
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,000
question is well in a nut show it's

1012
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,798
whether quantitative easing is a failure

1013
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,639
or is it responsible for this this this

1014
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:04,079
hidden subsidy yeah no no but what the

1015
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:06,440
question is the question was that the

1016
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,039
the reason for this subsidy to Banks is

1017
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,280
that there's been all this quantitative

1018
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:13,039
easing keeping short rates at zero of

1019
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,720
course that's given the subsidy to Banks

1020
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,480
does that mean the quantitative easing

1021
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:21,000
was actually a mistake no no I I think

1022
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,719
that that uh it was absolutely necessary

1023
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,280
uh to prevent a collapse uh so the

1024
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:31,039
authorities did the right thing uh

1025
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:34,040
with quantitative easing in my opinion

1026
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:38,480
the mistake they made was not to

1027
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:40,358
recapitalize banks on a compulsory basis

1028
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,880
uh uh but to

1029
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:47,000
inject uh these hidden subsidies to

1030
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:50,838
allow them to earn their way out of the

1031
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,599
hole the the injection should have been

1032
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:56,798
at the level of the capital not at the

1033
00:51:53,599 --> 00:52:02,920
level of the balance sheet and uh the

1034
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:05,400
700 billion uh of tarp uh money the

1035
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,760
originally voted would have been in my

1036
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:11,880
opinion enough to underwrite the

1037
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:15,839
recapitalization of of of the banks uh

1038
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:19,559
in other words uh the Scandinavian

1039
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:22,880
approach would have been more effective

1040
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:26,200
than the Japanese approach because we

1041
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,599
basically gone the Japanese route and as

1042
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:32,118
you know know after 18 years Japan is

1043
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,079
still not out of the woods but even if

1044
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:37,680
you did did recapitalize them if you

1045
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,960
give the banks money at 0%

1046
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,759
interest what is to stop them why

1047
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,400
shouldn't they invest it in government

1048
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,599
Bots at 3 and a half% and make these

1049
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,160
large profits yeah aren't you inevitably

1050
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:53,838
providing them with a subsidy well and

1051
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:55,920
and and if the banks didn't uh invest at

1052
00:52:53,838 --> 00:53:00,440
3 and a half% interest rate would not be

1053
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:03,000
3 and a half per but much higher so uh

1054
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:07,559
that's a that's part of the mechanism of

1055
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:11,639
quantitative easing basically uh the the

1056
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:16,519
point is that if you recapitalize the

1057
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:19,960
banks if you separated the old bank from

1058
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:24,039
the new bank and injected Capital into a

1059
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,760
new bank and allowed the old bank to run

1060
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:31,239
off its portfolio there would have be

1061
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:33,960
new Banks which are flush with deposits

1062
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:35,479
and capital looking

1063
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,440
for

1064
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,960
suitable investment opportunity or

1065
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:43,400
lending and therefore lending to the

1066
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:49,679
private sector they would have been much

1067
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:53,680
more ready to lend and to take risk okay

1068
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:55,679
uh thank you uh Charles Kovac ex-banker

1069
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:58,399
in any case uh while we're on the

1070
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:01,519
subject of the interest rates uh I just

1071
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,599
like to note that uh the 0% interest

1072
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,960
rate was not necessarily charged by the

1073
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,000
government for the money given to the

1074
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,760
banks but that is the short-term

1075
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,639
interest rate effectively paid to

1076
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,559
Consumers uh in the United States and

1077
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:18,039
that means that the demand dep deposits

1078
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:21,920
of the banks have become very cheap this

1079
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:24,440
goes a long way forward a lot more than

1080
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,119
just the uh monies that the governments

1081
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,280
have has in have invested um on the

1082
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,358
other hand uh don't you think that the

1083
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,798
lower interest rates which affect the

1084
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:35,920
entire economy are also driven by the

1085
00:54:33,798 --> 00:54:37,759
general recession which seems to be

1086
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,358
taking place in in the states it's not

1087
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,440
necessarily just Bank driven yeah OB

1088
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:44,920
obviously the fact that there is no

1089
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,760
private demand keeps interest rates

1090
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,680
lower than they would than it would

1091
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,880
would be otherwise that's no question

1092
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,919
could I ask you do you believe that that

1093
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,079
the bond market is in potentially a

1094
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,358
bubble you know you say we must look for

1095
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,720
Bubble every but do you think that Bond

1096
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:03,519
long-term Bond bonds at 3 and a half%

1097
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:06,199
given what's happening with the fiscal

1098
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:09,119
deficits all over the world that that

1099
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:13,199
this is also a dangerously unsustainable

1100
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:15,760
situ situation uh I think that that

1101
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,118
right now you're still in a deflationary

1102
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:21,799
environment although the economy is

1103
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:27,358
recovering and and as soon as it starts

1104
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:28,759
recovering uh um and you can you and the

1105
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:32,519
if the

1106
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:36,280
authorities don't manage it extremely

1107
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:38,798
skillfully uh the financial markets are

1108
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,079
going to get nervous about the prospect

1109
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:43,239
of the

1110
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:46,039
inflation and that would then push up

1111
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:48,639
interest rates and choke off uh the

1112
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:51,160
recovery and that in a way is

1113
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:56,798
reminiscent of what happened in the'

1114
00:55:51,159 --> 00:56:02,440
70s uh where you had stop go uh and and

1115
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:06,480
I think we we will be in a period of

1116
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:11,000
prolonged uh stagflation if you like or

1117
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:14,280
or or or uh or fears of stagflation yeah

1118
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,400
uh but I think the the the the the

1119
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,798
financial markets themselves will

1120
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,798
prevent inflation from getting out of

1121
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:25,119
hand there was a lady there at back

1122
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,559
hello my name is Lila stria I'm a

1123
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:31,440
registered auditor at business

1124
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:36,480
adviser uh I my question is about a

1125
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,760
book that was published uh in early 2009

1126
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:42,880
by Harry

1127
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:45,280
Dent uh this is a a an economist who was

1128
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,880
successful in predicting uh the major

1129
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:51,400
Bubbles and crisises that you were uh

1130
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,318
talking about and in this book he says

1131
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,838
that uh apart from quoting you that this

1132
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:59,519
is the the end of an era

1133
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:03,239
uh it describes quite a gloomy picture

1134
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:05,318
uh of the next few years even decade um

1135
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:09,199
he says that uh the Next Great

1136
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:10,400
Depression will be from 2008 to Lasting

1137
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:13,279
to

1138
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:16,838
2023 with the worst part start uh

1139
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:20,559
starting late 2009 making the Dow Jones

1140
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:22,519
falling to 3,800 points which will not

1141
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,480
recover until

1142
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:28,000
2017 so would you like to reflect on

1143
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,798
this thank thank you yes I I don't know

1144
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,119
who it is I haven't heard the name but I

1145
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:36,719
can disagree with it because on

1146
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:39,200
principle because I don't think that the

1147
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:43,759
future is predictable the way he's

1148
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:48,838
predicting it I mean my whole theory is

1149
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:52,240
that that uh uh financial markets evolve

1150
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:55,199
in a historic process and history is

1151
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:57,959
essentially unpredictable because it

1152
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:02,118
will depend on decisions that have not

1153
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,119
yet been taken so how can they be

1154
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,318
predicted yes the lady over

1155
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:10,318
there my name is Christina and I teach

1156
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:12,038
Finance at CU Business School uh Mr shos

1157
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,440
my question is you mentioned the

1158
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:18,359
conglomerate mergers in the 1960s as a

1159
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:21,559
contributor uh to the Bubba my question

1160
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:23,880
is whether the recent mer the recent the

1161
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:26,400
merger wave that started in the 1980s

1162
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,240
with the Strategic mergers of large

1163
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,400
companies has been

1164
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:33,679
contributing uh to uh the financial

1165
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,798
crisis on a longer term level by

1166
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:40,879
creating large players in the market for

1167
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:42,559
which lenders like to lend too thank you

1168
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,200
the question was you you said that in

1169
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,798
the 1960s the conglomerate Boom the merg

1170
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:49,838
Mania created a bubble do you think a

1171
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:52,559
similar a second round of merg mania

1172
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:55,000
from the 1980s onward which created

1173
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,680
bigger and bigger companies uh which

1174
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,719
wanted to deal with bigger and bigger

1175
00:58:56,679 --> 00:59:01,639
lenders was also a a contributor to to

1176
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:05,038
this latest

1177
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:08,519
bubble a minor contributor I would I I

1178
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:11,760
would say that it was not a central

1179
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:15,519
element in in in in the Super Bubble

1180
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,000
there was this uh and and obviously uh

1181
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:20,880
the concentration of the financial

1182
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,880
system is much more disturbing in that

1183
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:30,079
respect than con the concentration in

1184
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:33,760
the um uh the um uh normal

1185
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:35,680
industry except I would say the media

1186
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,559
but that's a different story because oh

1187
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:40,960
tell us about the media no no it has to

1188
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:44,000
do with the it has to do with democracy

1189
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,318
uh we're we just we want to see if if

1190
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:51,318
are there one or two more questions from

1191
00:59:47,318 --> 00:59:52,440
MIT okay I are there can we communicate

1192
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:55,838
with

1193
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,000
MIT tell them we will come back to them

1194
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,038
uh we we'll come back uh We've we've got

1195
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,358
about five minutes left so maybe there's

1196
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:04,240
time for one or two questions from MIT

1197
01:00:02,358 --> 01:00:07,960
after we've had another question from

1198
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:10,598
here yes sir in Middle there just a

1199
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,039
moment the

1200
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:17,039
microphone M wolitzky I'm not a

1201
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:20,039
financial expert I'm just a doctor and a

1202
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:23,119
taxpayer and my question is has anything

1203
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:25,440
what we have heard today to do with a

1204
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,358
taxpayer the bailout has definitely

1205
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,960
something to do with a taxpayer and is

1206
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:32,639
there a danger that at some point the

1207
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:35,798
taxpayers don't want to support this

1208
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:37,480
virtual system on top of them yes

1209
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:40,960
obviously the tax players are an

1210
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:46,440
important player players in this in this

1211
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:51,480
and they are politically uh uh objecting

1212
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:56,880
to the higher taxes uh that are implicit

1213
01:00:51,480 --> 01:01:02,838
in the runup of the of the U uh national

1214
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:05,599
debt uh but you have to bear in mind

1215
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:09,159
that there would be a an alternative

1216
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:12,480
cost if you did not stimulate the

1217
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:16,719
economy because and and you you really

1218
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:19,480
have to look at the national debt a a as

1219
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:22,558
as a percentage of the gross national

1220
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:26,358
product so if the gross national product

1221
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:30,559
Falls uh you can be in a debt

1222
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:33,558
trap uh that would be much worse than

1223
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:36,000
than than the stimulus so it's it's

1224
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:39,000
something it's a question of the Lesser

1225
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,079
evil that you have to consider right do

1226
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,079
we have a question from

1227
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,880
MIT no I I I I I think I think we we we

1228
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:52,480
can't we can't get through to that uh

1229
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,480
one more question then from the floor

1230
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,480
here

1231
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,400
Jay fogelman from The ceu Business

1232
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:07,480
School faculty Mr Shor as to pursue an

1233
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:09,559
earlier question uh you uh indicated yes

1234
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,679
that the the uh Financial system and the

1235
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,559
crisis that we're experiencing certainly

1236
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:17,159
has an international Dimension uh that's

1237
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,440
related to to globalization but I'm

1238
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:21,879
wondering more specifically whether

1239
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,639
changes in information technology and

1240
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,440
Communications technology the internet

1241
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:29,838
but much more than that

1242
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:32,720
has erased Geographic and cultural

1243
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:35,880
barriers and changed the speed of

1244
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:39,078
communication and has provided a glut of

1245
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:41,880
information much of it highly failable

1246
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:45,079
has this changed the function of of

1247
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:48,240
markets just in in quantitatively or is

1248
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:51,278
it a difference in kind no it certainly

1249
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:54,278
is also an element that has to be taken

1250
01:02:51,278 --> 01:02:56,798
into account it's not an essential

1251
01:02:54,278 --> 01:02:59,880
ingredient for say

1252
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:04,119
explaining what is going on but it is a

1253
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:06,880
contributing factor and uh and uh the

1254
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:09,720
element of time is

1255
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:14,358
extremely important particularly at

1256
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:17,000
times of Crisis where you just simply

1257
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:20,639
don't have the time

1258
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,480
to gather all the information that would

1259
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:26,480
be available if you had the time to

1260
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,719
collect it and that applies to Market

1261
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:33,159
participants and I can talk from

1262
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:37,519
personal experience and and also of

1263
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:41,199
course to the regulators and that is

1264
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:46,278
responsible for the increased liquidity

1265
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:50,318
preference that canes uh uh uh recognize

1266
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:53,559
and is a contributing factor in the

1267
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:56,759
severity or bringing on uh the crisis

1268
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:58,559
and when you look at the incredible

1269
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:03,119
increase in

1270
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:05,920
volatility uh that had to do partly with

1271
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:08,720
the increased speed of

1272
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:12,559
communications uh but mainly with the

1273
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:17,159
much increased range of of of

1274
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:19,760
uncertainty that that uh pervaded uh the

1275
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:22,000
market the fear of the

1276
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,960
unknown this is going to be the last

1277
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,039
question there's a gentleman there at

1278
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:29,480
the end

1279
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:31,799
good afternoon thank you very much for

1280
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:34,440
coming my question would be don't you

1281
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:38,358
think the biggest problem of this crisis

1282
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:40,559
is is judging the the crisis so we talk

1283
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:44,598
about regulation but the first step

1284
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,278
would be judging and as um Mr said this

1285
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:48,720
is international pretty much

1286
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:51,079
International crisis so the whole

1287
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:54,719
judging would be International who is

1288
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:56,519
the one who's the one in charge and and

1289
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,959
how what do you think about the first

1290
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:01,318
step because you say it's a huge crisis

1291
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,960
other people say it's not that

1292
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:05,920
huge uh the question is and I think it's

1293
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:10,039
a very good one to to round it off with

1294
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:14,278
that uh the biggest problem of a crisis

1295
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:16,359
like this is judging how serious it is

1296
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:18,679
who should be in charge if it's an an

1297
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:21,038
international crisis with International

1298
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:23,558
Dimensions is there an authority there

1299
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:26,480
who is in charge is there an authority

1300
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:28,000
that is able to assess how serious it is

1301
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,760
because some people say this is the

1302
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,679
worst crisis in human history others say

1303
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:36,319
well it's already over it what so how

1304
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:39,159
can you be confident that there is a

1305
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:41,000
regulator out there who can deal or a

1306
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:43,920
set of regulators out there who can deal

1307
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,559
with crisis actually you don't have a

1308
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:50,838
regulator out there and that is the

1309
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:53,798
challenge that confronts us because you

1310
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:56,759
financial markets have been globalized

1311
01:05:53,798 --> 01:05:59,480
but globalization was based on a false

1312
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:03,160
principle that markets don't need to be

1313
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:07,920
regulated therefore globalization and

1314
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:12,358
deregulation went together and you can

1315
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,760
deregulate uh in a in a way that forces

1316
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:17,159
the the

1317
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,079
recit countries to join the

1318
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:22,639
deregulation

1319
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:25,599
because deregulation puts capital in a

1320
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:27,838
position that it can move around freely

1321
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:30,000
and it can escape Taxation and

1322
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,358
Regulation and therefore it will go

1323
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,559
where it is deregulated and since

1324
01:06:32,358 --> 01:06:41,038
capital is in indispensable for for the

1325
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:43,119
economy countries had to compete in

1326
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:46,160
deregulating but when it comes to

1327
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:50,000
regulating it doesn't work the same way

1328
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:54,519
because the regulation at which is in

1329
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:57,440
existence is all based on the principle

1330
01:06:54,519 --> 01:07:00,559
of sovereignty

1331
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,200
and different nations have different

1332
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,160
interests

1333
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:08,598
therefore they they will

1334
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:11,920
regulate according to their their

1335
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:15,160
interests and that actually puts into

1336
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:18,838
place a very strong force for the

1337
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:20,278
disintegration of global markets through

1338
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:24,078
National

1339
01:07:20,278 --> 01:07:28,318
regulation and that and since a

1340
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,559
multi lateral system is more efficient

1341
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:34,239
than

1342
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:37,160
a bilateral system uh of

1343
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:40,519
regulations uh the challenge is how to

1344
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:42,719
create something which currently doesn't

1345
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:45,278
exist so it's not a question of

1346
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:49,798
restarting the economy it's a question

1347
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:53,639
of building a regulatory structure that

1348
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:56,639
was not created when markets were

1349
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:56,639
globalized

1350
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:05,639
well this is an exciting and and could

1351
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:08,960
go on much longer but I do want to thank

1352
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:13,358

audience at MIT and our equally Lively

1354
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:18,600
audience and highly interactive audience

1355

here at uh central European

1356
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,880
University um we will continue this

1357
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:26,039
journey

1358
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:29,520
tomorrow when Mr Soros will outline his

1359
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:32,039
concept of open society which is in many

1360
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:35,080
ways the heart of what central European

1361

University is all about I'm very

1362
