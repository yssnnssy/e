European

10
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:53,159
University in today's lecture Mr Soros

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,160
will discuss the concept of open society

12
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,000
which guides his philanthropy and is

13
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,679
Central to his political and social

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
thinking over the past quarter Century

15
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,640
as we all know he has devoted

16
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,879
unprecedented philanthropic support to

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,879
the underpinnings of this concept around

18
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,719
the world from equal access to Justice

19
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:13,759
to freedom of

20
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,679
expression these lectures are being

21
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,640

Global audiences of students in real

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,960

leader from Bulgaria Mr Soros will speak

32
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:49,359
for approximately 50 minutes after which

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,680
Mr crosi will offer his own brief

34
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,879
commentary Mr Soros will then take

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,719
questions as he has in previous days

36
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,000
starting with three questions today from

37
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,559
our audience at Columbia University and

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,680
then from the audience

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,280
here in Budapest now to deliver his

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,280
third lecture I'm delighted once again

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,840
to introduce George Soros who once again

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
needs no

43
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,920
introduction thank you very much today I

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:32,480
shall introduce the third pillar of my

45
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:36,079
conceptual framework namely open

46
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,679
Society in the previous lectures I was

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,360
summarizing the conclusions of a

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,239
lifetime of study and

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,760
experimentation here I will be breaking

50
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,878
new ground because my views on open

51
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:55,919
Society have changed over time and they

52
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:59,439
they are still evolving as a result the

53
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:03,399
next two lectures will be much more uh

54
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,400
expl exploratory in

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,640
nature the connection between open

56
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,560
society and reflexivity is far from

57
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:17,958
obvious on a personal level they are

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,199
closely connected as as you recall I was

59
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,519
studying

60
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:26,560
economics uh in at LSC and at the same

61
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,879
time I was reading Carl Popper's open

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,438
society and its enemies and it was

63
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:37,399
Papa's insistence on our inherent

64
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:40,438
fallibility that led me to question

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:45,560
basic the basic assumptions of economic

66
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:49,479
theory and develop the concept of

67
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,519
reflexivity but on a conceptual level

68
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:56,759
the connection is only indirect

69
00:03:52,519 --> 00:04:00,879
indirect it's is the first pillar the

70
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:04,399
fallibility that connects the other two

71
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,679
fallibility in this context means not

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,640
only that our view of the world is

73
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:15,280
always incomplete and distorted but also

74
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,719
that our in our effort to simplify an

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,519
extremely complex reality we often

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,240
misconstrue it and our misconceptions

77
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:28,240
play an important role in shaping the

78
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,319
course of

79
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,360
history if there is is anything really

80
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,800
original in my thinking is this emphasis

81
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,720
on

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,000
misconceptions it provides a strong AR

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,880
argument in favor of critical thinking

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,879
and open

85
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:53,000
Society POA didn't give an exact

86
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:56,399
definition of open Society because he

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,918
cons he considered exact definitions

88
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,599
incompatible with our imperfect

89
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,279
understanding he preferred to approach

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,680
things from the opposite direction by

91
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:12,679
first uh describing them and then giving

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,600
them a label uh the form of organization

93
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,720
he named open Society bore a close

94
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,840
resemblance to

95
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,199
democracy the net effect of his approach

96
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,719
was to justify democracy by an

97
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,759
epistemological

98
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,680
argument since perfect knowledge is

99
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,720
beyond the scope of the human intellect

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,959
a society characterized by the freedom

101
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,960
of speech and thought and free elections

102
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:45,478
is preferable to a society which imposes

103
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:48,120
its ideology by force having been

104
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,360
exposed to Nazi persecution and

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,720
communist oppression I found this

106
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,720
argument very

107
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,959
persuasive Papa's philosophy made me

108
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:03,360
more sensitive to the role of of

109
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:06,758
misconceptions in financial markets and

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,919
the concept of reflexivity allowed me to

111
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:13,080
develop my theory of bubbles this gave

112
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:17,159
me a leg up as a market

113
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:20,399
participant after a successful run as a

114
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,680
hedge fund manager I went through a kind

115
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:29,638
of midlife crisis I was approaching 50

116
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:33,360
my f hedge fund had grown to be 100 400

117
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:37,240
million of which 40 million belonged to

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,800
me personally I felt that I had made

119
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,038
more than enough money for myself and my

120
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,598
family and running a hedge fund was

121
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,399
extremely stressful and

122
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:49,279
depleting what would make it worthwhile

123
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,038
to

124
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:56,719
continue I thought long and hard and

125
00:06:53,038 --> 00:07:00,719
finally I decided to set up a foundation

126
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:04,560
devoted to the promotion of open Society

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,280
I defined its Mission as opening up

128
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,598
close societies uh correcting the

129
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:14,638
deficiencies of open societies and

130
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:18,719
promoting a critical mode of

131
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,960
thinking as time went by uh I became

132
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,400
increasingly involved in philanthropy I

133
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,318
established a

134
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:29,198
foundation here in Hungary in

135
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,400
1984 when it was still under communist

136
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,439
rule

137
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,878
in China in 1986 in Poland the Soviet

138
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,759
Union in

139
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:41,680
1987 and as the Soviet Union and

140
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,479
Yugoslavia disintegrated I set up a

141
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,280
network of foundations that covered

142
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:51,878
almost the entire former communist World

143
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:54,878
in this way I acquired some practical

144
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,080
experience in building open

145
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,000
societies uh I learned a lot I

146
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,359
discovered things that I should have

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,560
known in the first place for instance

148
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,720
that the disintegration of a close

149
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,720
societies doesn't necessarily lead to

150
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:17,240
the birth of open societies it may just

151
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,400
it may result in just continuing

152
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,759
disintegration until a new regime

153
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,959
emerges that bears more resemblance to

154
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,400
the regime that had collapsed than to an

155
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,399
open Society

156
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,479
the event that forced me to thoroughly

157
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,719
reconsider the concept of open Society

158
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,600
was the reelection of President Bush in

159
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,360
the United States in

160
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,959
2004 here was the oldest and most

161
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,480
successful democracy in the world

162
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:57,079
violating the principles for which it

163
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,839
was supposed to stand by engaging in

164
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,800
human rights violations in the the name

165
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,760
of fighting uh uh the a war on terror

166
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:11,278
and invading Iraq on false

167
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:14,958
pretenses yet he was

168
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,879
reelected how was that possible I had to

169
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:21,078
ask myself what was wrong with

170
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,679
America I wrote a couple of books trying

171
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:25,559
to answer that question I blamed the

172
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,078
Bush

173
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,958
Administration for misleading the people

174
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:32,759
and

175
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:36,199
I blamed the people for allowing the

176
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:40,159
Bush Administration to mislead

177
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,800
them as I probed deeper I started to

178
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,519
question my own conceptual framework I

179
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,240
discovered the flaw in the concept of

180
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,480
open

181
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:56,200
Society in in in in so far as Papa was

182
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,320
mainly concerned with the problems of

183
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,720
understanding reality he put forward an

184
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,519
epistemological rather than a political

185
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:11,399
argument in favor of open Society he

186
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:14,720
argued that and I quote only democracy

187
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:18,679
provides an Institutional framework that

188
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,720
permits reform without violence and the

189
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:25,639
use of Reason in

190
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,000
politics but that's the end of the quote

191
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,799
but his approach was based on a hidden

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,639
assumption asson namely that the main

193
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:38,120
purpose of thinking is to gain a better

194
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,839
understanding of reality and that was

195
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,159
not necessarily the case the

196
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,480
manipulative function could take

197
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:50,360
precedence over the cognitive function

198
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,399
indeed in a democracy the primary

199
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,959
objective of politicians is to get

200
00:10:53,399 --> 00:11:01,559
elected and stay in

201
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:03,838
power this rather obvious Insight raise

202
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:07,399
some additional questions about the

203
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,600
concept of open Society how how could

204
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:13,278
Papa take it for granted that free

205
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,240
political discourse is aimed at

206
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,519
understanding reality and more

207
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,680
intriguingly how could I who gave the

208
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,839
manipulative function pride of place in

209
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:30,359
the concept of reflexivity follow him so

210
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:34,240
blindly both questions led me to the

211
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,720
same conclusion our view of the world is

212
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,480
deeply rooted in an intellectual

213
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,639
tradition which either ignores the

214
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:47,680
manipulative function or treats it as

215
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:52,519
subservient to the cognitive

216
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:57,120
function it's easy to see why that this

217
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:59,959
uh this view of the world became so

218
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,078
ingrained the aim of the the cognitive

219
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:06,159
function is to produce knowledge

220
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:09,039
knowledge is expressed by statements

221
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,240
that correspond to the facts to

222
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,240
establish

223
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,159
correspondence statements and facts have

224
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,079
to be separate and

225
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:21,319
distinct hence the pursuit of knowledge

226
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:24,198
requires that thoughts should be

227
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:28,519
distinguished from their subject matter

228
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:30,519
this requirement LED philosophers whose

229
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,399
primary

230
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:37,278
preoccupation is with thinking to the

231
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:41,320
belief that reason and reality are

232
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:44,519
separate this dualism had its roots in

233
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,760
Greek philosophy and it came to dominate

234
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:51,078
our view of the world during the

235
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:54,639
Enlightenment the philosophers of the

236
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:57,399
Enlightenment put their faith in reason

237
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,320
reason was supposed to work like a

238
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:04,240
search light illumin ating a reality

239
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,760
that lay there passively awaiting

240
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,039
Discovery the active role that re reason

241
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:14,439
can play in shaping reality was largely

242
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:18,919
left out of account in other words the

243
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:22,720
enlightenment failed to recognize

244
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:26,198
reflexivity this resulted in a distorted

245
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,320
view of reality but one that was

246
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:33,319
appropriate to the age when it was

247
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,079
formulated at the time of the

248
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,839
Enlightenment humankind had as yet

249
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:44,479
relatively little knowledge or control

250
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:48,600
over the forces of nature and scientific

251
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,240
method held out infinite promise it was

252
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,159
appropriate to think of reality as

253
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,759
something out there waiting passively to

254
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:02,399
be discovered and reason as actively

255
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:05,079
engaged in exploring it after all at

256
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,078
that time not even the Earth had been

257
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,719
fully

258
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,359
explored Gathering facts and

259
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,920
establishing relationships among them

260
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,800
was richly

261
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:19,120
rewarding knowledge was being acquired

262
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:21,799
in so many different ways and from so

263
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,440
many different directions that the

264
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:27,719
possibilities seemed

265
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,279
unlimited reason was sweeping away

266
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,440
centuries of Trad additional

267
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:36,519
relationships and religious dogma and

268
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,519
generating a triumphant sense of

269
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,519
progress

270
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,278
the difficulties that reflexivity poses

271
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,000
to a proper understanding of human

272
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,480
Affairs went largely

273
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,039
unnoticed the leaders of the French

274
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,278
Revolution believed that reason could

275
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:22,278
help reconstruct Society from the ground

276
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:26,159
up but their faith in reason was

277
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:30,600
excessive Society failed to follow the

278
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:32,439
dictates of reason and the euphoria of

279
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,079
1789 uh

280
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,079
deteriorated into the terror of

281
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:45,318
1974 1994 1794 I'm

282
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,839
sorry the enlightenment misinterpreted

283
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:51,958
Reality by introducing a dichotomy

284
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,120
between thinking and reality which would

285
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:58,719
enable reason to attain perfect

286
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,360
knowledge the dichotomy was not in in

287
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,560
him ENT in the subject matter but

288
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,399
introduced by the philosophers of the

289
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:09,039
Enlightenment in their attempt to make

290
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,000
sense of

291
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:15,559
reality the mistake made by the

292
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,639
enlightenment has been given a name

293
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:22,278
postmodernists call it the enlightenment

294
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,278
fallacy I shall adopt that term but I

295
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:29,278
want to make it clear that I'm talking

296
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:32,318
about a fertile fallacy which contains v

297
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:36,039
a valuable kernel of

298
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:39,639
Truth let me explain more precisely what

299
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:43,198
I mean by a fertile fallacy we are

300
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:46,198
capable of acquiring knowledge but we

301
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:49,039
can never have enough knowledge to allow

302
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:52,278
us to base all our decisions on

303
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,838
knowledge it follows that if a piece of

304
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:58,360
knowledge has proved useful we are

305
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:01,839
liable to overe exploit it and extend it

306
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:05,240
to areas where it no longer applies so

307
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:08,000
that it becomes a fallacy that's what

308
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,318
happened to the enlightenment the

309
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,519
dichotomy between reason and reality

310
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:16,678
worked very well for the study of

311
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,759
natural phenomena but it was misleading

312
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,240
in the study of human

313
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:26,558
Affairs fertile fallacies are the

314
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,679
equivalent of bubbles in financial

315
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:32,200
markets the enlightenment fallacy

316
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,640
is deeply rooted in our view of the

317
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:40,200
world it led Carl poer to Proclaim that

318
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,559
the same standards and criteria applied

319
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,400
in both the natural and the social

320
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:49,000
sciences and it led economic theory to

321
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,600
model itself on Newtonian

322
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,038
physics neither Papa's elegant model of

323
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,519
scientific method no economic theory

324
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:02,158
recognized

325
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:04,679
reflexivity what worse even I who

326
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:07,480
discovered or invented reflexivity in

327
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,320
the financial markets failed to

328
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,440
recognize that Papa's concept of open

329
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:16,319
Society was based on the hidden

330
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,120
assumption that the cognitive function

331
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:22,639
takes precedence over the manipulative

332
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:25,038
function that we are pursuing the truth

333
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,080
and not simply trying to manipulate

334
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,759
people into believing what we want them

335
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,759
to believe

336
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:37,399
the enlightenment fallacy is also at the

337
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:40,798
root of the efficient market hypothesis

338
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,200
and its political derivative Market

339
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:47,720
fundamentalism the fallacy in these two

340
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,200
intellectual constructs was exposed in a

341
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,759
spectacular fashion by the collapse of

342
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,440
the financial system my discovery of a

343
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,079
flow in open Society was less

344
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,279
spectacular because the concept is

345
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,960
widely accepted but on a personal level

346
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,678
it was equally

347
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,840
earthshaking it forced me to rethink the

348
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,440
concept of open

349
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:16,480
Society I have not abandoned my belief

350
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,840
in the merits of open Society but I

351
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:24,120
realize that it needs stronger arguments

352
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:26,959
to butress it papa took it for granted

353
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:30,359
that in an open Society the cognitive

354
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,840
function takes precedence

355
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:37,240
I now believe that this has to be

356
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:40,798
introduced as an explicit requirement

357
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:45,400
for an open Society to flourish let me

358
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,400
explain how I reached that

359
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:52,799
conclusion in a

360
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,120
democracy political discourse is not

361
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:59,240
aimed at discovering reality that's the

362
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:02,199
cognitive function but getting El Ed and

363
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,880
staying in power that's the manipulative

364
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:09,360
function consequently free political

365
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,720
discourse doesn't necessarily produce

366
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:16,079
more farsighted policies than author and

367
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:20,759
that than an authorit authoritarian

368
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:24,319
regime that suppresses dissent to make

369
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:28,158
matters worse in the political battle to

370
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:31,639
manipulate reality a commitment to abide

371
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:34,520
by by by the truth has become a

372
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,600
handicap the Bush Administration had at

373
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:42,038
its disposal a powerful right-wing

374
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:45,678
propaganda machine working for it that

375
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:49,759
did not uh feel the need to respect the

376
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:52,919
facts this gave it a decided competitive

377
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:56,119
advantage over more old-fashioned

378
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:58,159
political practitioners who were still

379
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,239
under the influence of the Enlightenment

380
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,440
fallacy

381
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:07,120
and felt constrained by the

382
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,240
facts Frank Lun the one of the most

383
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:14,000
successful writing propagandists in the

384
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,159
United States openly admitted that he

385
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,440
used George Ells

386
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:23,278
1984 as his textbook in devising his

387
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:27,400
slogans as a believer in the open

388
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:29,159
Society I found this shocking how could

389
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,840
o valan news

390
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,480
be as successful in an open society as

391
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:38,599
in a totalitarian state with its

392
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,798
Ministry of Truth which could use

393
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:46,558
stalinist methods to keep people in

394
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:49,400
line this line of inquiry provided me

395
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:53,240
with a clue to the question what's wrong

396
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,360
with America people are not particularly

397
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,880
concerned with the pursuit of Truth they

398
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:02,199
have been conditioned by ever more

399
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,080
sophisticated techniques of manipulation

400
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:09,440
to the point where they don't mind being

401
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:12,960
deceived indeed they seem positively to

402
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:17,600
invite it people have

403
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,679
become used to receiving messages

404
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,798
prepackaged hence the influence of paid

405
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,038
political

406
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:27,759
advertising and they are more interested

407
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:29,359
in being entertained than informed hence

408
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:34,558
the influence of of populist

409
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,558
commentators like billowy or rash

410
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
limbo the techniques of

411
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,959
manipulation have developed gradually

412
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,519
over time they originated in the

413
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,960
commercial Arena towards the end of the

414
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,319
19th century when entrepreneurs

415
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,840
discovered that they could improve their

416
00:22:53,319 --> 00:23:00,599
profit margins by differentiating their

417
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:04,678
products through brand Ing and

418
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:07,798
advertising this prompted Research into

419
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:12,720
the motivation of consumers the testing

420
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:16,519
of messages and the use of of uh focus

421
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,919
groups uh uh setting in motion a

422
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:23,558
reflexive process which changed the

423
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,759
behavior of the public it led to the

424
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:30,960
development of a consumer society and

425
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:33,960
spread from there to politics and

426
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,120
culture these Trends

427
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,319
undermined the hidden assumptions on

428
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:44,199
which economics and politics were based

429
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:48,278
economic theory has taken the conditions

430
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:51,038
of demand and suppliers given and showed

431
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:52,159
how free markets under the conditions of

432
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,319
perfect

433
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,960
competition lead to the optimum

434
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:02,439
allocation of resources but the shape of

435
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:07,200
the demand curve was not independently

436
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:10,679
given it was subject to manipulation by

437
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,519
advertising the theory of repr

438
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,519
representative democracy assumed that

439
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,879
candidates would present themselves and

440
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:22,038
their programs and the electorate would

441
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,278
choose the ones they preferred it didn't

442
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:27,240
anticipate that the candidates would

443
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:30,079
study public opinion and then tell the

444
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,038
electorate what he wanted to

445
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:39,158
hear both these theories failed to take

446
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:39,158
into account that reality can be

447
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:48,480
manipulated the manipulation of

448
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:52,038
reality also became a major theme in the

449
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,798
Arts it was literary criticism that

450
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:58,000
eventually led to the development of the

451
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:02,599
postmodern worldview which turned the

452
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,398
enight enement upside down it denied the

453
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:08,639
existence of an objective reality that

454
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:12,558
could be discovered by reason instead it

455
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,360
saw reality as a collection of often

456
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:18,278
contradictory

457
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:22,199
narratives I had dismissed the

458
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:24,880
postmodern worldview out of hand because

459
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,440
it was in conflict with my profound

460
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,600
respect for an objective reality I I

461
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,880
didn't realize the connection between

462
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:37,599
the postmodern world viw and the bush

463
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,080
administration's propaganda machine

464
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:45,759
until I read an article by Ron Sask kind

465
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:49,240
which opened my eyes he quoted one of

466
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:52,558
the operators of that machine uh

467
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,720
supposed to be Carl Rove uh as saying

468
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:59,798
that we don't study facts we create them

469
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,360
this forced me to change my mind I had

470
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:06,679
to take the postmodern position more

471
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:10,398
seriously and recognize it as a fertile

472
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:13,240
fallacy fully equal in its influence to

473
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:15,839
the Enlightenment and currently perhaps

474
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,839
even more

475
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
influential but I still regard the

476
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:25,599
postmodern fallacy as more of a fallacy

477
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,960
and less fertile than the enlightenment

478
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:32,278
fallacy by giving precedence to the

479
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,519
manipulative function it ignores the

480
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:37,398
hardcoree of objective reality that

481
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,558
cannot be

482
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:43,959
manipulated this is more of a defect in

483
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:48,558
my eyes than the enlightenment's neglect

484
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,558
of the manipulative function

485
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,679
according to the

486
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:09,639
enlightenment

487
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:13,159
uh uh reason and reality are separate

488
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,880
and independent of each other the only

489
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:20,559
way people can turn reality to their

490
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,240
advantage is by understanding the laws

491
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:26,240
that determine the course of events

492
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,000
under these conditions it could be taken

493
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,159
for granted that this discovering those

494
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,398
laws had to come

495
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,840
first this led to the development of

496
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,359
natural science which is the greatest

497
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,639
achievement of the human intellect it's

498
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:47,519
only in the human Affairs in human

499
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:51,480
Affairs that the fallacy crept in by

500
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:55,480
contrast the postmodern worldview is

501
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:59,519
Thoroughly misleading it has St spawned

502
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:03,038
an aoral pragmatic approach in politics

503
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:06,480
it can be summed up as follows now that

504
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:09,038
we have discovered that reality can be

505
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,679
manipulated why should the cognitive

506
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:16,519
function be given precedence why not

507
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:19,840
engage directly in manipulation why not

508
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:24,079
pursue power rather than

509
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:26,720
truth now there is an answer to that

510
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:30,278
point of view that I find

511
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,558
decisive while reality can be

512
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:36,640
manipulated the outcome is bound to

513
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:39,798
diverge from the manipulators

514
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,919
intentions the Divergence needs to be

515
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:46,319
kept to a minimum and that can be done

516
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:49,480
only through a better understanding of

517
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,480
reality is this line of argument that

518
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,960
led me to introduce the

519
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:59,880
commitment uh introduce a commitment to

520
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,720
The Pursuit Of Truth as an explicit

521
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,720
requirement for open

522
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,640
Society this abstract argument can be

523
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,759
reinforced by a concrete

524
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,399
example uh look at the bush bush

525
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:21,119
presidency it was remarkably successful

526
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:23,879
in manipulating Reality by declaring war

527
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,319
on terror it managed to line up the

528
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,600
nation behind the president and uh pav

529
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:34,240
the way to the invasion of Iraq the

530
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:36,918
invasion was meant to establish the

531
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,720
supremacy of the United States in the

532
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:44,720
world but it achieved the exact opposite

533
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:48,120
America lost power and influence

534
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,600
precipitously and George W bush is

535
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:55,079
widely considered the worst president of

536
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:59,519
the United the United States ever

537
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:02,839
had this example ought to be convincing

538
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:06,159
yet now that the concept of reflexivity

539
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:09,599
is gaining recognition the danger is

540
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,880
that it will be misinterpreted in favor

541
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,959
of the postmodern

542
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:18,559
fallacy uh reflexive reality is just too

543
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,759
difficult to understand and people are

544
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:27,440
easily misled by simple answers it takes

545
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:30,278
a lifetime to understand the argument

546
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,360
that a a valid prediction doesn't

547
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:37,278
necessarily prove that the theory on

548
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:40,319
which it was based is also true while a

549
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,480
paid political announcement takes only

550
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:46,000
30

551
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:48,599
seconds is tempting to adapt the

552
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,480
postmodern view of the world but it's

553
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:54,398
very dangerous to disregard the

554
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:58,399
existence of an objective

555
00:30:54,398 --> 00:31:01,558
reality one way to bring home

556
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:05,079
OB objective reality is to draw

557
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:08,879
attention to to death as a fact of

558
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:13,199
life the Mind finds it difficult to

559
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,360
accept the idea of ceasing to exist and

560
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,159
all kinds of narratives and myths have

561
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:25,158
sprung up around the idea of life after

562
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:28,760
death I have been struck by an AE ritual

563
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:32,960
where teams compete in a ball game and

564
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:35,879
the winners are sacrificed to the gods

565
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,720
that's an extreme example of the power

566
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,960
of such myths yet the fact remains that

567
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,880
the winning team

568
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:48,240
died even

569
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:52,320
so I have to admit that the absence of

570
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:56,839
of of uh life after death can't be

571
00:31:52,319 --> 00:32:00,439
proven to those who who believe in it my

572
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:03,918
insistence on the importance of the

573
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:07,639
objective aspect of reality is a matter

574
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,600
of personal belief indeed it has a

575
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:13,719
curious resemblance to a religious

576
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:18,158
belief the objective aspect of reality

577
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:21,720
as I have constructed it has many of the

578
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,240
attributes of God as conceived in

579
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,679
monotheistic

580
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:30,278
religions it's omnipresent and all

581
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:33,080
powerful yet yet the ways of its working

582
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:36,119
remain somewhat

583
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:39,398
mysterious now I hold the objective

584
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:42,558
aspect of reality in very high regard

585
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:45,678
and I used to think that that is the

586
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:48,798
norm I've come to realize that my

587
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,519
attitude is quite unusual and it has to

588
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:54,319
do with my personal

589
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,558
history the formative experience of my

590
00:32:54,319 --> 00:33:00,278
life was the German occupation of

591
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:02,839
Hungary in 194 44 uh under the wise

592
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:06,038
guidance of my father we not only

593
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:09,158
survived but managed to help others in a

594
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:12,960
situation full of dangers this turned

595
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:16,240
1944 into a positive experience for me

596
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,798
and gave me an appetite for confronting

597
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,638
harsh

598
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:23,839
reality this attitude was reinforced by

599
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:26,599
my involvement in the financial markets

600
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,398
I was a risk taker and often pushed

601
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:31,278
matters to their limit

602
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:33,398
but avoided going over the brink I

603
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:36,558
learned to protect myself against

604
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:39,038
unpleasant Surprises by looking looking

605
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:42,678
out for all the things that could go

606
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:46,638
wrong I chose Investments where the risk

607
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:49,960
reward ratio remained uh attractive even

608
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:53,839
under the worst assumptions this made me

609
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:57,278
emphasize the Dark Side of every

610
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,000
situation then I became active with my

611
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,720
Foundation

612
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,798
uh here the fact that I could do

613
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,480
something positive to to alleviate

614
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:11,599
Injustice increased my willingness to

615
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:14,838
recognize and confront harsh realities a

616
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,079
negative assessment became an invitation

617
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:21,199
for positive

618
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:24,280
involvement my Foundation ended up

619
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:28,158
devoting much of its resources to

620
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:31,879
seemingly insoluble problems like drug

621
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:36,000
policy and seemingly hopeless cases like

622
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:40,159
Burma Haiti Liberia Sierra Leon or the

623
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,719
Congo needless to say fighting Lo losing

624
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,679
battles is not the preferred choice of

625
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,158
most

626
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:50,639
foundations my commitment to the

627
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:54,240
objective re aspect of reality plays the

628
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:58,000
same role in my thinking as religion

629
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:01,399
does in other people's in the absence of

630
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,320
perfect knowledge we need beliefs I

631
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,680
happen to believe in harsh reality while

632
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,920
other people believe in

633
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:15,279
God nevertheless I would argue that when

634
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,680
Society ignores the objective aspect of

635
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,880
reality it does so at its own

636
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:25,118
Peril if we try to avoid unpleasant

637
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,320
realities by deceiving ourselves or the

638
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:32,280
electorate reality will public will

639
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,760
punish us by failing to meet our

640
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:38,320
expectations yes reality can be

641
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,960
manipulated but the results of our

642
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,640
actions are governed not by our desires

643
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,880
but by an external reality whose

644
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:50,440
workings we cannot fully comprehend the

645
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,640
better we understand it the closer the

646
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,679
outcome will correspond to our

647
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:58,239
intentions understanding reality is the

648
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:00,598
cognitive function

649
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,358
that's why the cognitive function ought

650
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,359
to take precedence and guide the

651
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:09,078
manipulative function ignoring an

652
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:13,920
objective reality that can't be fully

653
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:19,039
understood leads to the postmodern uh

654
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:22,079
fallacy so in recent history mankind has

655
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,079
adopted two fallacies about the

656
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,280
relationship between thinking and

657
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:31,200
reality the enlightenment fallacy and

658
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,599
the post modern fallacy they are related

659
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:39,000
to each other the enlightenment fallacy

660
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:42,280
failed to recognize the uh prevalence of

661
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,679
manipulation in human in the human

662
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,280
sphere and the discovery of the

663
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:51,559
manipulative function led to the

664
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:55,519
postmodern fallacy each of them

665
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:57,639
recognizes one half of a complicated

666
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:01,358
relationship

667
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:05,199
my conceptual framework being based on

668
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:09,199
the twin principles of fallibility and

669
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:11,318
reflexivity combines the two halves both

670
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:14,239
fallacies have been

671
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:17,440
influential but the

672
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:20,439
framework I I've put forward has

673
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,039
received little acceptance and this goes

674
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:28,039
to show how easy it is to misinterpret

675
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:31,039
reality much easier than to gain a prop

676
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,039
proper

677
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,880
understanding the postmodern fallacy is

678
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,960
now in the

679
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,960
ascendant it guided the policies of the

680
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,440
Bush

681
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,639
Administration and I noted alarm that it

682
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:56,960
has surfaced in the Obama Administration

683
00:37:53,639 --> 00:38:00,358
as well I referred to a recent book by

684
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,039
George kof and Robert Schiller animal

685
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:06,119
spirits that has been influential in

686
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:08,440
shaping the economic policies of the OB

687
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,240
Obama

688
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,159
administration that book extols the

689
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:17,199
merits of the confidence

690
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:20,279
multiplier that is to say the ills of

691
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:23,480
the economy can be can be cured by

692
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,319
talking up the financial markets now

693
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,760
that is half true the stock market

694
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:32,599
really has allowed Banks to raise

695
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,520
capital and strengthen the economy in

696
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:39,760
other ways as well but the confidence

697
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:43,000
multiplier disregards the other half of

698
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,440
the truth that if reality fails to

699
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,639
conform to expectations confidence can

700
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,559
turn into

701
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:53,838
disappointment boom can turn to

702
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:56,838
bust I'm deeply worried that by

703
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:59,799
deploying the confidence multiplier

704
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:03,199
president Obama has taken ownership of

705
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:07,440
the recession and if there is a relapse

706
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,439
or uh he will be blamed for

707
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:22,559
it this discussion should help to

708
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:25,760
clarify my theory of reflexivity by

709
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:28,358
putting it into context of two false

710
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,079
interpretations of reality

711
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:34,838
in particular a a a point that may not

712
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,720
have come through loud and clear needs

713
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:42,358
to be emphasized that there is a

714
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:44,719
hardcore of of of of objective reality

715
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:49,119
that can't be manipulated like the

716
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,719
inevitability of death is this

717
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:56,079
hardcore

718
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:59,519
if that is ignored by the postmodern

719
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:03,079
fallacy and embolden emboldened by my

720
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:05,800
recent successes I will go so far as to

721
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:09,079
claim that my conceptual framework

722
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,599
provides the correct interpretation of

723
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:15,920
reality that's a bold claim and at first

724
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:19,440
sight it seems to be self-contradictory

725
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,960
how can a correct interpretation of

726
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,318
reality be be reconciled with the

727
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:30,960
principle of inherently imperfect

728
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:34,519
understanding Easy by pointing out that

729
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,199
reflexivity introduces an element of

730
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:40,719
uncertainty both into the participants

731
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:44,039
thinking and into the course of events a

732
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:48,439
framework that claims that the future is

733
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:52,759
inherently uncertain can't be accused of

734
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:55,960
perfection yet it can provide important

735
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,839
insights into reality it can even

736
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:01,199
anticipate the future

737
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:05,000
within bounds although the bounds

738
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:07,159
themselves are uncertain and variable as

739
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,679
we have seen in the recent financial

740
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:14,838
crisis by recognizing uncertainty my

741
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:17,679
framework manages to be both

742
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:21,279
self-consistent and consistent with

743
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:24,679
reality yet since it's less than perfect

744
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:28,240
it holds itself open to

745
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:31,358
Improvement actually I see tremendous

746
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:34,078
scope for further development my

747
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:37,358
original framework formulated under the

748
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:40,480
influence of Carl poer dealt only with

749
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:43,440
the problems of understanding reality

750
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,838
but when I added the requirement that

751
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,000
the electorate should cherish

752
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:52,318
truthfulness and punish deception I

753
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,280
entered the realm of values in that

754
00:41:52,318 --> 00:42:00,000
realm uncertainty is even more prevalent

755
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,079
than in the fear of cognition therefore

756
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,039
a lot more thinking needs to be

757
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:09,599
done as we have seen the truth is

758
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:13,559
difficult to establish and often hard to

759
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,280
Bear the line of least resistance leads

760
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,199
in the opposite direction to avoid

761
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:22,760
unpleasant realities and reward

762
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:25,799
deception as long as it remains

763
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:29,319
convincing these Tendencies need to be

764
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,680
resisted for an open Society to remain

765
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:34,358
open and to

766
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,639
flourish this prescription is

767
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:39,639
particularly relevant to the United

768
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,480
States at the present time because the

769
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:45,118
United States is facing a particularly

770
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,400
unpleasant set of realities in the

771
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,519
aftermath of the financial crisis the

772
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,800
country has been living beyond this

773
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,719
means for the last quarter of a century

774
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:02,079
and making ends meet by Bor growing

775
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:05,318
abroad now the housing bubble has burst

776
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,640
consumers are overextended and need to

777
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:11,679
rebuild their savings the banking system

778
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,719
has collapsed and needs to to earn its

779
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:16,358
way out of a

780
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:18,439
hole the Bush Administration had

781
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:21,719
deliberately misled the electorate when

782
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,880
it invaded Iraq on false pretenses the

783
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:28,118
Obama Administration can't be accused of

784
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,599
deliberate deception never nevertheless

785
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:34,240
it has accepted that the country is

786
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:37,359
unwilling to face harsh realities and

787
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:40,598
deployed the confidence

788
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:43,960
multiplier unfortunately the objective

789
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:47,240
reality is unlikely to fulfill the the

790
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,920
hopes raised by the confidence uh

791
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:52,919
multiplier at the same time the

792
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,280
political opposition is not constrained

793
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:59,599
by facts in attacking the president in

794
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,400
these circumstan es the requirement that

795
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,119
the electorate should be more committed

796
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,240
to the pursuit of truth will be

797
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:10,400
difficult to meet it provides a good

798
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:13,399
agenda for my Foundation but the current

799
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,000
state of Democracy in America does not

800
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,920
strengthen the case for open society as

801
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,920
a superior form of social

802
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,920
organization I need to find a stronger

803
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:31,440
argument a better case can be found

804
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,119
by reverting to the founding fathers who

805
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,079
formed their views long before the

806
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:40,039
concept of open open Society was

807
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:43,039
introduced the founding fathers buil

808
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:46,279
that case on the value of individual

809
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:49,800
Freedom the epistemological argument

810
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:53,040
they employed was flawed the Declaration

811
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,160
of Independence states that we hold

812
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,199
these truths to be

813
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:01,039
self-evident and there is nothing

814
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:04,199
self-evident about them but self-evident

815
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:08,639
or not the value of individual freedom

816
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:11,598
is enduring and having been exposed to

817
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:14,960
totalitarian regimes I'm passionately

818
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:18,680
devoted to it and I'm not

819
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:22,280
alone reverting to the founding fathers

820
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:23,919
has another great Advantage it allows a

821
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,000
discussion of power

822
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,760
relations the Constitution protected

823
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,119
against tyranny by a division of powers

824
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,520
the division of powers recognizes that

825
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:38,640
there are competing interests and

826
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:41,199
different interpretations of reality

827
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:44,960
within society which need to be

828
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:47,439
reconciled by a political process the

829
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,720
Constitutional checks and balances

830
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:54,318
preclude the formation of uh absolute

831
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:57,480
power that could claim to be in

832
00:45:54,318 --> 00:46:00,960
possession of the ultimate truth the

833
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,000
Constitution establish a mechanism where

834
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,800
different branches of government

835
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,318
interact and control each other but that

836
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:14,359
is not sufficient open Society can

837
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:18,358
Prevail only when people can speak truth

838
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:21,159
to power it needs the rule of law that

839
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:24,279
guarantees freedom of speech and press

840
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:27,039
freedom of Association and assembly and

841
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:30,440
other rights and freedoms they imp EMP

842
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:33,920
power citizens to defend themselves

843
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:37,440
against the absolute power of the state

844
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:41,119
and to make use of the judicial branch

845
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:46,519
for such defense that's how the founding

846
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:50,119
fathers creating created an open

847
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:51,159
Society let me spell out my conclusion

848
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:55,519
more

849
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:57,558
clearly open Society is a desirable form

850
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:01,519
of social organization

851
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:06,000
both as a means to an end and as an end

852
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:09,440
in itself it establish it it enables a

853
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,599
society to understand the problems

854
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,358
confronting it and to deal with them

855
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,318
more successfully than other forms of

856
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,358
social

857
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:22,199
organizations provided it gives

858
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:25,558
precedence to the cognitive over the

859
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:29,279
manipul manipulative function and the

860
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:32,000
people are willing to confront harsh

861
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,119
realities in other words the

862
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,880
instrumental value of democracy is

863
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,760
conditional on the qualities of the

864
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,880
electorate and the current performance

865
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:48,720
of American democracy doesn't live up to

866
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:52,240
its P past achievements we can't rely on

867
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:57,358
the inherent superiority of the American

868
00:47:52,239 --> 00:48:00,399
model and need to prove ourselves a new

869
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:04,519
but quite apart from its instrumental

870
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,599
value open Society also has an intrinsic

871
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:10,599
value namely the freedom of the

872
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,480
individual which implies whether open

873
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:18,160
Society flourishes or not for instance

874
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,440
it applied to the Soviet

875
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:24,639
Union of course the freedom of the

876
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,480
individual must be made compatible with

877
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,879
the public interest and the the freedom

878
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,599
of other

879
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,280
individuals moreover the intrinsic value

880
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:37,119
of individual Freedom falls short of

881
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,720
being of

882
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:43,039
self-evident for instance it's not

883
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:45,239
generally recognized in China where the

884
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,800
interests of the collective take

885
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:51,000
precedence over the interests of the

886
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,280
individual this was the clear message of

887
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,280
the opening ceremony of the Olympic

888
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:00,480
Games it showed that by doing exactly

889
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,400
what they are what they are told and

890
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,798
exactly at the right time a large

891
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,680
collection of individuals can produce a

892
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:11,039
superb

893
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:13,480
spectacle with the changing power

894
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:17,000
relations between the United Station and

895
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:20,119
China the value of individual freedom is

896
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,679
likely to in to assume increasing

897
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:27,599
importance in the immediate future and I

898
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:30,289
will address that subject in my last

899
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:41,250
lecture thank you

900
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:41,250
