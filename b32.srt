1
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,080
good afternoon and welcome to the fifth

2
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:28,039
and final session in our series of ceu

3
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:31,118
lectures I'm John shatak president and

4
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,880
director of central European University

5
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,238
we're starting just a little bit late so

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,079
we will go a little bit longer Beyond

7
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,238
3:00 I'm sure you'll all agree that this

8
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,640
has been an extraordinary

9
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:45,280
week and it's been my great privilege

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,679
over the course of the week to host

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,399
these pathbreaking lectures by George

12
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:53,079
Soros held here in Budapest at the

13
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,600
Hungarian Academy of Sciences under the

14
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:00,359
offices of central European University

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,558
today we have reached the grand finale

16
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,159
never one to shrink from controversy or

17
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,640
prediction today George Soros will bring

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,200
together the themes he has been

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,640
exploring throughout the week and turn

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,240
his attention to the future he will

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,040
outline key Global Trends and discuss

22
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,199
their economic and political

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,000
implications as he sees them for the

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,520
years ahead focusing in particular on

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,799
the increasingly important role that

26
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,438
China is likely to play on the world

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,040
stage as we've done throughout the week

28
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,158
we're expanding our audience today far

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,320
beyond Budapest and are including

30
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,320
students appropriately from China from

31
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:43,519
Hong Kong University this will complete

32
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,519
our unprecedented three continent five

33
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,798
University Global Outreach to students

34
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,519
who are participating in these lectures

35
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,479
through interactive video conferencing

36
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,718
in real time our moderator for this

37
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,319
lecture is Howard Davies director of one

38
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,438
of the world's great universities the

39
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,438
London School of economics and political

40
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:06,758
science whose students were part of our

41
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,280
Global audience on Monday we also have a

42
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,878
distinguished former International

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,039
leader here in the front row who will

44
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:16,199
offer a brief commentary from the floor

45
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,598
uh Christan boar a Brazilian Senator and

46
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,719
former candidate for president Mr Soros

47
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,959
will speak for approximately 50 minutes

48
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,199
following which Mr Davies will briefly

49
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,319
comment Mr Soros will then take

50
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,399
questions starting with three questions

51
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,280
from Hong Kong and then more questions

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,560
from the audience here in Budapest and

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,318
now to deliver his Fifth and final

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,840
lecture I'm delighted once again to

55
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,518
introduce George Soros who will take us

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,840
into the future with a grand summation

57
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,840
of his thinking about our

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,800
world thank you

59
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:09,840
in these lectures uh I've offered a

60
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,839
conceptual framework for a better

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,360
understanding of human

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,719
events these events are not determined

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,239
by timelessly valid scientific laws such

64
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:26,080
laws exist of course but they are not

65
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,878
sufficient to determine the course of

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,239
events the complexity of the situations

67
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:36,518
is one reason and the role of the

68
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:40,319
participants thinking is

69
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,920
another I have focused on the reflexive

70
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,878
two-way connection between the

71
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:50,839
participants thinking and reality and I

72
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:53,078
emphasized the causal role that

73
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,400
misunderstandings and misconceptions

74
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,360
play in shaping

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,560
reality but these influences have been

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,840
strangely ignored

77
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,079
they introduce an element of uncertainty

78
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,560
into the subject matter which except in

79
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,480
the simplest situations make it

80
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:18,280
impossible to predict the future one can

81
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:21,279
still sketch various plausible scenarios

82
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:23,519
and evaluate their likelihood one can

83
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,159
also prescribe desirable

84
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:30,240
outcomes I've done both many times

85
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,720
indeed I can claim to be a

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,400
specialized a specialist in it uh

87
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,199
focusing on predictions as an investor

88
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,319
and prescriptions as a

89
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,960
philanthropist I've been successful

90
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,439
enough in the former to be able to

91
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,638
afford the

92
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:55,000
letter I should like to devote today's

93
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,000
discussion to this dual

94
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:03,199
task we are at a moment in which the

95
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,359
range of uncertainties is unusually wide

96
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,680
we've just passed through the worst

97
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,520
financial crisis since World War I is

98
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,000
quantitatively much larger and

99
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:16,240
qualitatively different from other

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,680
financial

101
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,079
crisis the only relevant comparisons are

102
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,918
with the Japanese uh real estate bubble

103
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,159
which burst in

104
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,560
1991 and from which Japan has still not

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,199
recovered

106
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,680
and with the Great Depression of the

107
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,759
1930s what differentiates this crisis

108
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,360
from the Japanese experience is that the

109
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,199
letter was confined to a single country

110
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,199
while this crisis has involved the

111
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,879
entire

112
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,160
world what differentiates it from the

113
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,639
Great Depression is that this time the

114
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,280
financial system was not allowed to

115
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,079
collapse what but was put on artificial

116
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:05,519
life support

117
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:09,758
in fact the magnitude of the credit and

118
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:12,159
leverage problem uh we have today is

119
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,598
even greater than in the

120
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,360
1930s in

121
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:22,598
1929 total credit outstanding in the

122
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,840
United States was 160% of GDP and it

123
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:26,319
Rose to

124
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:30,239
250% by

125
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,240
1932 in 2008 we started

126
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,560
at

127
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,319
365. and this calculation doesn't take

128
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,879
into account the pervasive use of

129
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,240
derivatives which was absent in the

130
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:48,759
1930s and yet in spite of that the

131
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,918
artificial r support has been successful

132
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,199
barely a year after the bankruptcy of

133
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:57,359
Leman Brothers financial markets have

134
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:00,120
stabilized stock markets have rebounded

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,680
and the economy is showing signs of

136
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,720
recovery people want to return to

137
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,319
business as usual and think of the crash

138
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,599
of 2008 as a bad

139
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,680
dream I regret to tell you that the

140
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:18,839
recovery is liable to run out of steam

141
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,038
and may even be followed by a double dip

142
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:26,159
although I'm not sure whether it will be

143
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:30,079
in 2010 or

144
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,759
2011 My Views are far from unique but

145
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:37,159
they are at variance with the prevailing

146
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:40,240
mood the longer the turnaround lasts the

147
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,080
more people will come to believe in it

148
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,400
but in my judgment the prevailing mood

149
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:50,478
is far removed from reality this is

150
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:54,198
characteristic of far from equilibrium

151
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,519
situations when perceptions tend to lag

152
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,759
behind

153
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:02,079
reality to complicate matters the lag

154
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,879
Works in both directions most people

155
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,598
have not yet realized that this crisis

156
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,680
is different from previous ones that we

157
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:14,079
are at the end of an era others

158
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,000
including me failed to anticipate the

159
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,000
extent of the

160
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:26,720
rebound the confusion is not confined to

161
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:30,878
the financial sphere it extends to the

162
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,759
entire International Arena

163
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,839
after the collapse of the Soviet Empire

164
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:40,559
the United States emerged as the sole

165
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:44,080
superpower no other power or combination

166
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:48,399
of powers could challenge its

167
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,240
Supremacy but the unipolar world didn't

168
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,839
take root when President Bush sought to

169
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,639
assert americ Supremacy by invading Iraq

170
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:03,040
on false pretenses he achieved the exact

171
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:06,360
opposite of what he intended the United

172
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,159
States suffered a precipitous decline in

173
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,399
its power and

174
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:14,000
influence so the disarray in the

175
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:18,759
International Financial system is

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,720
matched by instability in international

177
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:24,919
relations the New Order that will

178
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,160
eventually emerge will not be dominated

179
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:31,360
by the United States to the same extent

180
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,360
as the old one

181
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:41,958
to understand what's happening we need a

182
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:45,679
this different conceptual framework from

183
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:48,599
the one to which we have become

184
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:52,799
accustomed the efficient market

185
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,240
hypothesis looks at financial markets in

186
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:59,078
isolation and totally disregards

187
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,600
politics but that gives a distorted

188
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:03,479
picture

189
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,320
as I have pointed out several times

190
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,039
behind the Invisible Hand of markets

191
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,079
there is the visible hand of politics

192
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:14,639
which establishes the rules and

193
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:18,319
conditions in which the market mechanism

194
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:22,120
operates my conceptual framework relates

195
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,480
to the political economy not the market

196
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,679
economy as an abstract construct that is

197
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:34,000
governed by timelessly valid laws I look

198
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:34,000
at financial markets as a branch of

199
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:42,039
History the International Financial

200
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,399
system as it was uh reconstructed after

201
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:49,319
the second world war didn't create a

202
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:52,480
Level Playing Field it was lopsided by

203
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,800
Design the international financial

204
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,920
institutions the international monetary

205
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:02,639
fund and the World Bank were organized

206
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:05,159
as shareholding companies in which the

207
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:09,560
rich countries held a disproportionate

208
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:12,600
share of the votes and also controll the

209
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:16,479
boards this put the countries at the

210
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,480
periphery at a disadvantage Visa those

211
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,000
at the

212
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,240
center ever since the system has been

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,360
dominated by the United

214
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,799
States at the Breton Woods conference

215
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,440
Lord KES proposed but it was the head of

216
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:37,278
the American delegation Harry white who

217
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,079
disposed since then we have gone from an

218
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,759
almost an almost completely regulated

219
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:46,399
system to an almost completely

220
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:50,439
deregulated one but the changes were led

221
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,720
by the United States and the system has

222
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,720
continued to be guided by what has

223
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,079
become known as the Washington

224
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,440
consensus although

225
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:06,199
the rules laid down by the Washington

226
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,040
consensus consensus are supposed to

227
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,200
apply to all countries equally the

228
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:15,759
United States as the issuer of the main

229
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,720
International currency is more equal

230
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,879
than the

231
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,720
others effectively the International

232
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:26,600
System has a two-tier structure

233
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,199
countries that can borrow that can

234
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,360
borrow in their own currency constitute

235
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:35,919
the center and those whose borrowings

236
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,639
are denominated in one of the hard

237
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,240
currencies constitute the

238
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,159
periphery if individual countries get

239
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,600
into

240
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,399
difficulties they receive assistance but

241
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,120
only on strict

242
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,320
conditions that holds true whether they

243
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,078
are from the center or from the

244
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,360
periphery but if the center itself

245
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:02,120
becomes endangered then preserving the

246
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,480
system takes precedence over all other

247
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,480
cons

248
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,759
considerations that happened for the

249
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,958
first time in the international banking

250
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:24,480
crisis of

251
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:27,479
1982 um if the D dat countries had been

252
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,360
allowed to default the banking system

253
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,039
would have collapsed therefore the

254
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,560
International Financial authorities

255
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:39,159
baned it together and introduced what I

256
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,599
called the the time the collective

257
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:45,519
system of

258
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:50,360
Landing the leaders the lenders were uh

259
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:53,720
induced to roll over their loans and the

260
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:57,240
D countries were lent enough additional

261
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:01,399
money to service their debts the net

262
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,959
effect was that data countries fell into

263
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:08,639
severe recession Latin America lost a

264
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:11,359
decade of growth but the banking system

265
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:16,000
was allowed to earn its way out of a

266
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:19,720
hole when the banks built up sufficient

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,759
reserves the the uh loans were

268
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,278
restructured into so-called Brady bonds

269
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:31,039
and the

270
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:31,039
banks uh wrote off their remaining

271
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,559
losses something similar happened again

272
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:39,360
in

273
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:42,359
1997 but by then the banks had learned

274
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,560
to securitize their loans so they

275
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,240
couldn't be forced into a collective

276
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:51,119
system of landing and most of the losses

277
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,079
had to be taken by the data countries

278
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,759
this set the pattern the data countries

279
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,479
were subjected to harsh Market

280
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,800
discipline but when the system was in

281
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,639
danger the nor normal rules were

282
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:08,919
suspended Banks whose Collective failure

283
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,320
would have endangered the system were

284
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,319
bailed

285
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:20,079
out the financial crisis of 2007 2008

286
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:23,000
was different because it originated at

287
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:25,919
the center and the periphery countries

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,360
were drawn into it only after the

289
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:34,479
bankruptcy of Leman Brothers the MF was

290
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:37,680
faced with a novel task to protect the

291
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,920
periphery from a storm that originated

292
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,758
at the

293
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:46,159
center it didn't have enough Capital but

294
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,919
member countries bend it together and

295
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:51,600
raised a trillion

296
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,799
dollars even so the IMF had some

297
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,240
difficulties in coping with the

298
00:15:53,799 --> 00:16:00,519
situation because it was designed to

299
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,919
deal with problems in the public sector

300
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,000
and the shortage of credit uh was

301
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:09,240
impacting mainly the private sector but

302
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,958
on the whole the IMF adapted itself to

303
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:17,720
its novel task uh remarkably

304
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:21,399
well overall the International

305
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:25,480
Financial authorities have handled this

306
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:28,440
crisis the same way as previous ones

307
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,120
they bailed out the failing institutions

308
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,480
and appli Li monetary and fiscal

309
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,839
stimulus but this crisis was much bigger

310
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:42,560
and at first the same techniques didn't

311
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:46,720
work the rescue of Leman Brothers

312
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:50,879
failed that was a game changing

313
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,680
event financial markets actually ceased

314
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,600
to function and had to be put on

315
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,638
artificial life

316
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,839
support this meant that governments had

317
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,519
to effectively guarantee that no other

318
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,199
institution whose failure would endanger

319
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,959
the system would be allowed to

320
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,759
fail that's when the crisis spread to

321
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,360
the periphery because periphery

322
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,919
countries couldn't provide equally

323
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,399
credible

324
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,919
guarantees this time it was Eastern

325
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,280
Europe that was the worst hit the

326
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,960
countries at the center used the balance

327
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,879
sheets of their central banks to pump

328
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,679
money into the system and to guarantee

329
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:40,200
the liabilities of commercial Banks and

330
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:43,240
governments engaged in deficit financing

331
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,798
to stimulate the economy on an

332
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,400
unprecedented scale and these measures

333
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,639
have been successful and the global

334
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,640
economy appears to be

335
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,080
stabilizing there is a growing belief

336
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,280
that the Global Financial system has

337
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:03,480
once again escaped collapse and we are

338
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:07,720
slowly returning to business as

339
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,519
usual this in my opinion is a grave

340
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,919
misinterpretation of the current

341
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:18,400
situation Humpty Dumpty can't be put

342
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:18,400
together again let me explain why

343
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,600
the globalization of financial markets

344
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,558
that took place since the

345
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:43,759
1980s was a market fundamentalist

346
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,759
project spearheaded by the United States

347
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,200
and the United Kingdom allowing

348
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:52,359
Financial Capital to move around freely

349
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,880
in the world made it difficult to tax it

350
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:59,479
or to regulate it this put Financial

351
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:02,200
capital in a privileged position

352
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,400
governments had to pay more attention to

353
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,200
the requirements of international

354
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,679
Capital than to the aspirations of their

355
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,960
own people because Financial Capital

356
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,159
could move around more freely so as a

357
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,038
market fundamentalist project

358
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,400
globalization was highly successful

359
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,640
individual countries found it difficult

360
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,759
to resist it but the Global Financial

361
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,759
system that emerged was fundamentally

362
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:34,599
unstable because with it was built on

363
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:38,119
the false premise that financial markets

364
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:41,839
can be left safely left to their own

365
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:45,959
devices that is why it broke down and

366
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:50,119
that's why it can't be put together

367
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,558
again Global markets need Global

368
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,879
regulations but the regulations that are

369
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:59,480
currently in force are rooted in the

370
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,159
principle of national sovereignty

371
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,240
there are some International agreements

372
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:08,120
most notably the Basel Accords on

373
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,440
minimal Capital requirements and there's

374
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,719
also good cooperation among Market

375
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,038
Regulators but the source of the

376
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:20,720
authority is always the sovereign

377
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:24,158
state this means that it's not enough to

378
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,319
restart a mechanism that has stall we

379
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,799
need to create a regulatory mechanism

380
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:33,119
that has never existed

381
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:36,119
as things stand now the financial system

382
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:39,079
of each country is being sustained and

383
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:42,038
supported by its own government the

384
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:45,359
governments are primarily concerned with

385
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:47,519
their own economies this stands to give

386
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,319
rise to financial

387
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:54,319
protectionism which threatens to disrupt

388
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:57,439
and perhaps destroy the global financial

389
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:01,359
markets British Regulators will never

390
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,919
again rely on Icelandic authorities and

391
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:07,279
countries at the periphery will be

392
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,400
reluctant to be entirely dependent on

393
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:14,278
foreign owned

394
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:18,519
Banks the point I'm trying to make is uh

395
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:21,919
that Regulators must be in regulations

396
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:26,558
must be International in scope without

397
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:29,840
it financial markets can't remain Global

398
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:33,038
they would be destroyed by regulatory

399
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:35,480
Arbitrage businesses would move to the

400
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,839
countries where the regulatory climate

401
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,798
is the most benign and this would expose

402
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,959
other countries to risks they can't

403
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:46,839
afford to

404
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,600
run globalization was so successful

405
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:52,240
because it forced all countries to

406
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,119
remove regulations but the process

407
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,120
doesn't work in

408
00:21:54,119 --> 00:22:00,000
Reverse it will be difficult to get

409
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,519
countries to agree un uniform

410
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,720
regulations different countries have

411
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,639
different interests which drive them

412
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,640
towards different

413
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:17,000
solutions this can be seen in Europe and

414
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,640
if European countries can't agree among

415
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,880
themselves how can the rest of the

416
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:27,559
world during the crisis Europe couldn't

417
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,679
couldn't reach a europe-wide agreement

418
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:34,158
on guaranteeing the financial system

419
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:39,798
each country had to guarantee its own as

420
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:43,440
things stand now the the um euro is an

421
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:46,359
incomplete currency it has a common

422
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,440
central bank but it doesn't have a

423
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:54,000
common Treasury and guaranteeing or

424
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,240
injecting Equity into Banks is a

425
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,640
treasury

426
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:02,720
function the crisis offered an opport

427
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,080
Unity to remedy this shortfall but

428
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,640
Germany stood in the

429
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:12,678
way Germany used to be the driving force

430
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,520
behind European integration but that was

431
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:19,278
at a time when Germany was willing to

432
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:22,558
pay practically any price for

433
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:25,640
reunification today Germany is very

434
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:29,079
different it's a it's at odds with the

435
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,720
rest of the world in fearing inflation

436
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:35,759
rather than recession and above all it

437
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,480
doesn't want to serve as the deep pocket

438
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:43,000
for the rest of Europe without a driving

439
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,880
force European integration has ground to

440
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,159
a

441
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,278
halt

442
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,919
fortunately Europe had the benefit of

443
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:54,159
the social safety

444
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:57,200
net it had held down European growth

445
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,200
rates in good times but it served its

446
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,240
purpose in the downturn and the

447
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:07,120
recession in euroland turned out to be

448
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:10,960
less severe than expected now that the

449
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:14,079
fears of an economic coll collapse have

450
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,919
subsided the European Union is showing

451
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,639
some signs of political

452
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,840
Revival for instance the European

453
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,320
Central Bank has effectively bailed out

454
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:28,918
the Irish banking system and Ireland has

455
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:32,839
resoundingly endorsed the L

456
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:35,159
treaty so perhaps I should not be so

457
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:38,720
pessimistic about

458
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:42,520
Europe the fact that the financial

459
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,480
crisis is having long-term different

460
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:49,278
long-term impacts on different countries

461
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,640
may turn out to be more of a problem in

462
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:55,038
the short term all countries were

463
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,480
negatively affected but in the long term

464
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:01,038
there will be winners and losers

465
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,120
although the range of uncertainties for

466
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:07,359
the actual course of events is very wide

467
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:09,359
shifts in relative positions can be

468
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,599
predicted with greater

469
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:16,038
certainty to put it

470
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:19,959
bluntly the United States stands to lose

471
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:21,359
the most and China is poised to emerge

472
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,640
as the greatest

473
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:28,918
winner the extent of the shift is

474
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,880
already exceeding most expectations

475
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,679
there will be significant changes in the

476
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,159
relative positions of other countries as

477
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:41,080
well but from a Global Perspective the

478
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,399
one between the United States and China

479
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:46,240
is the most

480
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:48,479
significant the United States has been

481
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,240
at the center of the International

482
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,200
Financial system ever since the second

483
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,798
world war the dollar has served as the

484
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,480
main International currency and the

485
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:03,158
United States has derived immense

486
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:06,480
benefits from that position but lately

487
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:11,240
it has abused its privilege starting in

488
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,440
the 19 1980s it has built up an ever

489
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,519
increasing current account

490
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,480
deficit this could have continued

491
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:22,679
indefinitely because the Asian tigers

492
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,839
first under the leadership of Japan and

493
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:28,519
now of China were willing to finance

494
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:32,839
that deficit by building up their dollar

495
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:36,038
Holdings but the excessive indebtness of

496
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:39,199
the United States households brought the

497
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:43,278
process to an end when the housing

498
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,759
bubble burst households found themselves

499
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,759
overextended the banking system has

500
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,720
suffered tremendous losses and has to

501
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:54,079
earn its way out of a whole in

502
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:58,038
commercial real estate and leverage

503
00:26:54,079 --> 00:27:00,879
buyouts the blood leting is Yet to Come

504
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:04,158
the these factors will continue to weigh

505
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,720
on the American economy and the American

506
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:11,159
Consumer will no longer be able to serve

507
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:15,480
as the as the motor for the world

508
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:18,840
economy to some extent China may be able

509
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,960
to take its place China has been the

510
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:23,359
primary beneficiary of

511
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,960
globalization and it has been largely

512
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:31,479
insulated from the financial crisis for

513
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:34,759
the West ER in and the United States in

514
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,440
particular the crisis was an internally

515
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:40,079
generated event which led to the

516
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,798
collapse of the financial system for

517
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:47,759
China it was an external shock which has

518
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:51,519
hurt exports but left the financial

519
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:54,519
political and economic system

520
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,880
unscathed China has discovered a

521
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,640
remarkably efficient method of

522
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,960
unleashing the

523
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,720
creative acquisitive and entrepreneurial

524
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,200
energies of the people who are allowed

525
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,319
to pursue their

526
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,558
selfin while the state can cleam off a

527
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,798
significant portion of the Surplus value

528
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:19,879
of their labor by maintaining an

529
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:21,639
undervalued currency and accumulating a

530
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,399
a a trade

531
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,919
surplus so China is likely to emerge as

532
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:30,479
the big

533
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:34,480
winner now now China is not a

534
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:38,360
democracy and the rulers know that they

535
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,519
must a uh avoid social unrest if they

536
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:44,079
want to remain the rulers therefore

537
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,640
they'll do anything in their power to

538
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:51,359
maintain economic growth at 8% or more

539
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:54,840
and create new jobs for a growing work

540
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:58,639
Workforce and they have plenty of power

541
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:02,079
because of the trade surplus China can

542
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,960
stimulate its domestic economy through

543
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:08,639
infrastructure Investments and it can

544
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,840
foster its exports by investing in and

545
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,840
extending credit to their trading

546
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:17,879
partners after all that's what China was

547
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:21,720
doing when it was financing it exports

548
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,880
to America by buying US government bonds

549
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,440
now that the American consumers have to

550
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,240
cut back they can do the same with other

551
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,840
countries

552
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,960
so China will be a positive force in the

553
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:38,519
world economy while the United States

554
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,840
will be limping

555
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:45,278
along the Chinese economy is of course

556
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:48,398
much smaller than the United States with

557
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:51,919
a smaller motor the world economy is

558
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:55,959
like likely to move forward at a slower

559
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,240
Pace but Within These limits a tectonic

560
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,558
shift is taking place between between

561
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,679
the United States and China with third

562
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:07,359
parties reorienting themselves to the

563
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:11,000
source of positive

564
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,319
impulses the shift may not be permanent

565
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,679
or

566
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:20,480
irreversible just think of the rise and

567
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:23,360
fall of China Inc but at the present

568
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,919
moment it constitutes the most

569
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,719
predictable and significant Trend in the

570
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:32,519
global political

571
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:36,120
economy and China is pulling its trading

572
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:40,159
partners like Brazil and some African

573
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:45,599
and Asian countries along with it India

574
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,600
is also doing well based on domestic

575
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:52,798
growth the success of Chinese Economic

576
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,918
Policy can't be taken for

577
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:59,558
granted the infrastructure investment in

578
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,919
the Chinese Hinterland may or may not

579
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:06,558
generate self- sustaining economic

580
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:09,440
growth under the Chinese system the

581
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:12,759
return on new Investments is generally

582
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,080
very low because investment decisions

583
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:18,278
are dictated by political rather than

584
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,678
commercial

585
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:25,000
considerations on the previous two

586
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:29,000
occasions the relaxation of bank credit

587
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,759
has produced a Spate of bad loans

588
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,278
this time it may be different because

589
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:37,759
there has been a shift in power from the

590
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:40,638
regional to the central authorities and

591
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:44,720
the local officials of the banks are no

592
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:48,798
longer uh under the control of the local

593
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:53,278
provincial authorities but success can't

594
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:56,759
be taken for granted moreover China may

595
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:59,720
be dragged down by a global so slowdown

596
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:03,000
but if China flounders the global

597
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,960
economy loses its motor therefore the

598
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,880
relative success of China is more

599
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,880
assured than its absolute

600
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:29,278
success we are at a moment in history

601
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:32,960
which in some ways is comparable to the

602
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:36,000
end of the second world war then the

603
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,278
prevailing system had actually collapsed

604
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,599
and the new one had to be built from

605
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:46,240
scratch at Breton Woods the Victorious

606
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:49,398
Powers approved equal to the task

607
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,079
inspired mainly by Lord KES they built a

608
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:55,439
system that could accommodate the entire

609
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:59,638
world even if the United States was more

610
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,320
equal than others now now the prevailing

611
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:05,398
multilateral system call it

612
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:08,558
International capitalism didn't fully

613
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:12,599
collapse but it has been greatly

614
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:17,599
weakened its inherent flaws have been

615
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:21,519
revealed and is challenged by a viable

616
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:24,759
alternative the rise of China offers a

617
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,159
fundamentally different form of economic

618
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:30,638
organization than the current

619
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:34,559
International Financial system it may be

620
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:36,918
given the label of State capitalism as

621
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:41,119
distinct from the international

622
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:44,200
capitalism championed by the Washington

623
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,879
consensus we are at the end of an era

624
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,960
but we are not fully aware of

625
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,760
it the two forms of economic

626
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,360
organization State capitalism and

627
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:58,398
international capitalism are in

628
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,719
competition with each other neither of

629
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,719
them is

630
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,880
attractive the Washington consensus has

631
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,358
failed International capitalism in his

632
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:12,079
present form has proven itself

633
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:15,039
inherently unstable because it lacks

634
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,280
adequate regulation it's also highly

635
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,440
unjust because it favors the haves over

636
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,679
the Have

637
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:27,039
Nots at the same time an international

638
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,440
system based on state capitalism would

639
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:33,679
inevitably lead to conflicts between

640
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:37,918
states the first sign of conflict are

641
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,480
already beginning to surface because

642
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,559
ironically China is repeating the

643
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,079
mistakes of the colonial powers in

644
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:50,759
dealing with the countries that are rich

645
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:53,839
in natural resources just at a time when

646
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,960
the colonial Powers have learned from

647
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,159
their past mistakes and are trying to

648
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,400
rectify

649
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:04,399
them in order to gain access to Natural

650
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,079
Resources China is dealing with the

651
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,599
rulers and neglecting the people this

652
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:15,240
helps oppressive and corrupt regimes to

653
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,280
stay in power this is an undesirable

654
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:21,838
outcome but China is not the only one to

655
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:25,720
be blamed for it when a Chinese company

656
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:28,719
tried to buy Unocal the American Oil

657
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:33,000
Company it was rebuffed and more

658
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:36,439
recently riotinto reneged on a deal to

659
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,639
sell an interest to a Chinese company

660
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,119
this has pushed China into dealing with

661
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:45,159
those countries that the International

662
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:50,358
Financial in institutions have shunned

663
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:55,039
Burma Sudan Zimbabwe and the Congo and

664
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:56,400
Angola they stand out Guinea uh is the

665
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:01,480
latest

666
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:04,519
example uh where uh there's been a riot

667
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:08,240
with 150 people killed and China has

668
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:11,559
extended a loan of $7

669
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:14,679
billion this is becoming a source of

670
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:17,480
considerable friction which is not in

671
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:20,799
the best interest of China later on the

672
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:25,039
rest of the world but China considers

673
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:28,079
itself the grief party and Rel is

674
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:31,400
remains reluctant to join the extractive

675
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,839
Industries transparency initiative this

676
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:39,240
has become become the biggest obstacle

677
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:39,239
to the continued success of that

678
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,039
initiative while the prevailing

679
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:47,639
multilateral system will try to

680
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:51,599
reconstitute itself China will expand on

681
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:54,519
a bilateral basis China is of course

682
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,200
part of the multilateral system but it

683
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,159
doesn't occupy within that system a

684
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,199
position

685
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:04,598
that is Comm measur it with its current

686
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:08,039
and anticipated prospective strength

687
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:10,720
therefore it its participation in the

688
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:14,639
international financial institutions is

689
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:17,759
rather passive and its active expansion

690
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:22,039
is lying to go through bilateral

691
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,960
challenge for instance China will uh

692
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:27,519
complain about the role of the dollar

693
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,199
and will promote the role of speci

694
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:33,280
special drawing rights but it's unlikely

695
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:36,239
to allow the remin to become freely

696
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,240
convertible because that would destroy

697
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,919
the mechanism that has allowed the state

698
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,759
to harvest the fruits of cheap Chinese

699
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,318
labor through an undervalued

700
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:51,000
currency China will continue to maintain

701
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:54,279
Capital controls but will establish

702
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,679
bilateral clearing accounts denominated

703
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:00,880
in Remi with countries like Brazil

704
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,039
this will diminish the status of the

705
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,760
dollar as the international currency

706
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,759
without actually replacing

707
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:16,399
it to sum up the world is facing a

708
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,880
choice between two fundamentally

709
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,358
different forms of

710
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,480
organization we may label them

711
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:26,719
International capitalism and state

712
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,639
capitalism the former represented by the

713
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:33,838
United States has broken down and the

714
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:37,078
letter represented by China is in the

715
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:40,358
ascendant the path of least least

716
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,440
resistance leads to the gradual

717
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:46,759
disintegration of the International

718
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:50,599
Financial system as we know it yet a

719
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:53,400
system of bilateral relations is liable

720
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:57,280
to generate conflicts between

721
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,599
states a new multilateral system based

722
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,839
on and Sounder principles needs to be

723
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,599
invented that would serve the best

724
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:10,519
interests of both the United States and

725
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,519
China and of course the rest of the

726
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,318
world now while International

727
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:19,838
cooperation is almost impossible to

728
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:23,440
achieve on a peaceful basis it may be

729
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:28,318
attainable in a gr Grand bargain where

730
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:32,440
the entire Financial order is rearranged

731
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:36,199
the emergence of the G20 as the primary

732
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:39,000
Forum of international cooperation and

733
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:42,078
the peer review process adopted at the

734
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,079
Pittsburgh meeting are steps in the

735
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,720
right

736
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:49,880
direction but the G20 has to operate

737
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:52,799
within the confines of the Articles of

738
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,000
Association of the IMF as they are

739
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,119
currently because changing the articles

740
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,159
is a long drawn AR

741
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:04,760
process this is what a New Breton Woods

742
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:08,879
conference could accomplish in one f

743
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:11,359
swop it would reconstitute the IMF to

744
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,200
better reflect the prevailing packing

745
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,559
order among states and revise its

746
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:18,799
methods of

747
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:21,480
operation it would decide how to treat

748
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,680
financial institutions that are too big

749
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:29,119
to fail and it would consider new rules

750
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:32,118
to control capital mve movements because

751
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,400
the total freedom of financial Capital

752
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:38,838
to move around freely in the world has

753
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:42,160
proved to be a source of instability and

754
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:42,159
needs to be

755
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:48,960
corrected the use of the dollar as the

756
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:50,480
main International currency has produced

757
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,760
dangerous

758
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:57,358
imbalances the dollar is no longer no

759
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:01,400
longer enjoys the trust and confidence

760
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:04,880
it once did yet no other currency is in

761
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:08,599
a position to take its place there is a

762
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,440
general flight from currencies into gold

763
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:14,880
and other Commodities and tangible

764
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:18,039
assets that's harmful because it keeps

765
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,280
those assets out of productive use and

766
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:24,559
Stokes the fears of

767
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,680
inflation the United States ought not to

768
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,838
shy away from The Wider use of special

769
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:33,279
drawing rights

770
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:35,838
sdrs uh that should induce China to

771
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,319
abandon it back to the dollar and that

772
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,519
would be the best way to reduce

773
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:44,838
International

774
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:47,800
imbalances since sdrs are denominated in

775
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:51,559
several National currencies no single

776
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,560
currency would enjoy an unfair

777
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:57,679
Advantage the range of currencies

778
00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:00,318
included in the sdrs would have to be be

779
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,919
widened and some of the newly added

780
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,599
currencies which would in include the

781
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:08,358
rembe may not be fully

782
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,559
convertible therefore the dollar could

783
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:14,799
still reestablish itself as the preser

784
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:18,639
as the preferred Reserve currency

785
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,839
provided is properly prudently

786
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,679
managed one of the great advantages of

787
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:27,400
sdrs is that they allow the

788
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:30,279
international creation of money that

789
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,240
would be particularly useful at times

790
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,760
like the

791
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:37,838
present the money could be directed to

792
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,599
where it is most needed that would be a

793
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,078
gr great improvement over what's

794
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:45,240
happening

795
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,760
currently a mechanism which would allow

796
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,519
rich countries that don't need

797
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,559
additional reserves to transfer their

798
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:56,280
allocations to those who need them is

799
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:59,359
readily available and has already been

800
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,440
used on a small

801
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,960
scale the

802
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:09,880
reorganization of the prevailing World

803
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:13,358
Order uh uh may have to extend uh behind

804
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:16,838
beyond the financial system if we are to

805
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:20,480
make progress in resolving issues like

806
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:22,799
global warming and nuclear proliferation

807
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,400
it may have to involve the United

808
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:29,119
Nations especially membership of the

809
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,119
security

810
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:37,039
Council this uh rather profound process

811
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,280
needs to be initiated by the United

812
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:43,519
States but China and other developing

813
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:46,800
countries ought to participate in it as

814
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:49,838
equals they are reluctant members of the

815
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,280
brettonwoods institutions which are

816
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:55,960
dominated by countries that are no

817
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:58,119
longer dominant the the rising Powers

818
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,358
need to be present at the creation of

819
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:04,680
the new order to ensure that there'll be

820
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,679
active supporters of

821
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:12,599
it now why should the United States

822
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:15,159
initiate changes in a system of which it

823
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:18,079
had been the main

824
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:20,719
beneficiary because the system can't

825
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:24,680
survive in its present form and the

826
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:28,318
United States has more to lose uh if it

827
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:31,440
is not in front Forefront of reforming

828
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:34,719
it America lost a lot of power and

829
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,838
influence during the bush presidency

830
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:40,719
without farsighted leadership the

831
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:44,159
relative position of the United States

832
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:47,239
is like likely to continue

833
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:50,279
eroding the United States is still in a

834
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:53,239
position to lead the world it can no

835
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,200
longer impose its will on others as the

836
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:59,558
Bush Administration sought to do but it

837
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:02,558
could lead a a Cooperative effort which

838
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:06,000
would involve not only the developed but

839
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:08,920
also the developing world this would

840
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,880
reestablish American leadership in an

841
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,960
acceptable

842
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,760
form now why should China submit to a

843
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,119
new multilateral system in view of the

844
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,200
fact that it is set to emerge as the

845
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:26,280
winner from the current turmoil the

846
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:29,279
answer is equally simple in order to

847
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:32,599
continue Rising it must make itself

848
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,440
acceptable to the rest of the world that

849
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:40,640
means that it must move towards a more

850
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:43,440
open Society uh um combining an

851
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,879
increased measure of individual Freedom

852
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,760
with the rule of

853
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,358
law given the current military power

854
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:55,400
relations China can continue Rising only

855
00:45:52,358 --> 00:46:00,960
in a peaceful environment where the rest

856
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:05,519
of the world willing accept the rise of

857
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:08,480
China it's even more important for the

858
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:11,480
sake of a peaceful world that the United

859
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,318
States should find its proper place in a

860
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:18,800
new world world order a declining

861
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:22,159
superpower losing both political and

862
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,318
economic dominance but still preserving

863
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:28,078
military

864
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:30,800
Supremacy is a dangerous mix and as I've

865
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:34,680
tried to show democracy is in deep

866
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:37,480
trouble in America the financial crisis

867
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:40,719
has inflicted hardship on a population

868
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:44,400
that doesn't like har to face harsh

869
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:47,598
reality President Obama has deployed the

870
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,519
confidence multiplier and claims to have

871
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:54,680
contained the recession if there is a d

872
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:57,159
a double dip the population will become

873
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:59,960
susceptible to all kinds of

874
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:03,679
fear-mongering and populist

875
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,800
demagogy if President Obama fails the

876
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:09,759
next Administration will be sorely

877
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:12,480
tempted to create diversions from

878
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,440
troubles at home and that could be very

879
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,480
dangerous for the

880
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,400
world President Obama has the right

881
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,240
Vision but he needs to be more

882
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:28,400
farsighted he believes in international

883
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:32,439
cooperation rather than the bush Cheney

884
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:35,838
idea of Might is right but he is pre

885
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:38,240
preoccupied with many pressing problems

886
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:42,239
Reinventing the International Financial

887
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:45,239
system is not high on his agenda some of

888
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:47,639
his economic advisers still seem to

889
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:51,919
believe that the efficient market

890
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:55,199
hypothesis is valid except once in a 100

891
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,119
years the financial institutions that

892
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:00,838
have survived are are in a stronger

893
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:04,640
competitive position than ever before

894
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:06,880
and they will resist a systemic overhaul

895
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:10,400
that would curve their

896
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,240
powers what is lacking is a general

897
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,920
recognition that the system is broken

898
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:19,799
and needs to be reinvented that's why it

899
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,559
would be so important that the theory of

900
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:28,039
financial markets I've outlined in these

901
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,040
lectures should gain wider acceptance

902
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:34,358
the Chinese leadership would need to be

903
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,679
even more F farsighted than President

904
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:39,799
Obama they are in the driver's seat and

905
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:43,239
if they moved towards a more open

906
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,559
Society they would have to give give up

907
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:48,318
some of their

908
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,920
privileges right now the Chinese public

909
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:53,440
is willing to subordinate individual

910
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,280
freedom to political stability and

911
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,838
economic advancement but that may not

912
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,079
continue

913
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:04,838
indefinitely corruption is a big problem

914
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:07,318
and China needs the rule of law so that

915
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:10,039
citizens can criticize the government

916
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:13,759
and prevent it from abusing it Powers

917
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:16,838
its powers and China needs to become a

918
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:20,119
more open Society in order to be

919
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:23,719
acceptable to the rest of the world the

920
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:25,920
rest of the world will never subordinate

921
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:28,199
the freedom of the individual to the

922
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,519
prosperity of the the Chinese

923
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:34,679
State as China is becoming a world

924
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:37,199
leader it must learn to pay more

925
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:40,919
attention to the opinion of the rest of

926
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:44,000
the world but all this may be happening

927
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:48,240
too fast for the Chinese leadership to

928
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:51,440
adjust to it China is accustomed to

929
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:53,239
think to thinking of itself as a as the

930
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,039
victim of

931
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:59,639
imperialism so it doesn't realize that

932
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:02,159
is beginning to occupy an imperialistic

933
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:04,519
position that's why it has such

934
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:08,759
difficulties in De in dealing with

935
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:11,838
Africa and its own ethn ethnic

936
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:14,960
minorities hopefully the Chinese

937
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:17,920
leadership will rise to the occasion

938
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:22,119
it's no exaggeration to say that the

939
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,220
future of the world depends on it thank

940
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:37,099
you

941
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:37,098
[Applause]
