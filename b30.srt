2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:07,200
in the course of my lifetime I developed

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:10,399
a conceptual

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,719
framework with the financial crisis it

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,839
does have a relevance to other people

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:20,480
for their understanding of this very

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,160
complicated

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,800
reality thank you very much the

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,560
formative experience of my life was the

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,839
German occupation of Hungary in

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,920
1944 I was not yet 14 years old at the

12
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:38,479
time coming from the first two lectures

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,359
kind of summarize the experience of of

14
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:45,038
of of my past the concept of reflexivity

15
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:48,198
provided me with a new way of looking at

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,640
financial markets a better way than the

17
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:53,599
prevailing

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,600
Theory the entire edifice of global

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,359
financial markets that has been erected

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,920
on the false premise that markets can be

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,960
left to the their own devices has to be

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,200
rebuilt from the ground up the next two

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:11,158
lectures are exploratory new ideas that

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,960
I am developing

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:20,000
now open Society can Prevail only when

26
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:23,078
people can speak truth to power it needs

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,478
the rule of law that guarantees freedom

28
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:28,239
of speech and press freedom of

29
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:31,158
Association and assembly and other

30
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:34,438
rights and freedoms

31
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,520
there is a deep seated conflict between

32
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:41,879
capitalism and open Society Market

33
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:44,840
values and social values in the end how

34
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,839
a democracy functions depends on the

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,680
people who live in

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,840
it the fifth lecture is of course the

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
conclusion that brings it together to

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,280
put it

39
00:01:52,879 --> 00:02:01,399
bluntly the United States stands to lose

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,320
the most and China is boys to emerge as

41
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,519
the greatest winner there is a growing

42
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,799
belief that the Global Financial system

43
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,039
has once again escaped collapse and we

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,120
are slowly returning to business as

45
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,919
usual this in my opinion is a grave

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,319
misinterpretation of the current

47
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:26,159
situation Humpty Dumpty can't be put

48
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,159
together again thank

49
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:34,518
you it is a summing up of a life

50
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,639
philosophy but it's not a closed system

51
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,158
it's an open system that can develop a

52
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:43,919
lot more and I hope that other people

53
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:47,799
will be inspired uh by this approach and

54
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,799
and develop it further

55
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,830
