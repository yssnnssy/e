1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,990
a few weeks ago mr. Soros asked me as a

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,528
preparation for this job I'm doing at

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,120
the moment

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:14,519
to research the intellectual antecedents

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,948
if any of the notion of reflectivity

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,948
which was thought about for so many

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:24,769
years and is explaining to you today so

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:28,560
I said okay I can do that so my first

9
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:32,988
recourse was to go to Wikipedia and

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:37,349
well-known resource and I typed in

11
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:41,488
self-fulfilling prophecy first and page

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,859
came up and I started to read it and the

13
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:46,140
first thing that's noted in the in that

14
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:49,530
entry was that the man called Robert K

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,280
Merton a sociologist invented the phrase

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,020
self-fulfilling prophecy which

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,049
apparently derives from the Thomas

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,930
theorem which states that quote if men

19
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:04,558
define situations as real they are real

20
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:07,709
in their consequences so a reading

21
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,259
through this entry first of all I came

22
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:12,209
across the quote from Robert Merton

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,830
himself and he was discussing the case

24
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:18,959
of a bank run caused by a crisis of

25
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,629
confidence in the solvency of the bank

26
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,658
so Merton concludes the example by

27
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:26,329
saying quote the parable tells us that

28
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,490
public definitions of a situation

29
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:31,978
prophecies or predictions become an

30
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,890
integral part of the situation and thus

31
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:37,769
affect subsequent developments this is

32
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,719
peculiar to human affairs it is not

33
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:42,719
found in the world of nature untouched

34
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,090
by human hands predictions of the return

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,269
of Halley's Comet not influence its

36
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,609
orbit but the rumored insolvency of

37
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:53,219
milling wheels Bank did affect the

38
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,728
actual outcome the prophecy of collapse

39
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,109
led to its own fulfillment

40
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:01,228
that's mertens explanation of his

41
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:05,539
concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy as

42
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:08,038
I read through very soon we have a quote

43
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,679
preceded by philosopher Karl Popper

44
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,099
called the self-fulfilling prophecy the

45
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,849
Oedipus effect

46
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:18,729
this is a quote from poppers

47
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:20,560
autobiography unending quest he says one

48
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,019
of the ideas I discussed in the poverty

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,530
of historicism was the influence of a

50
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,670
prediction upon the event predicted I

51
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,860
called this the heed abyss effect

52
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:32,129
because the Oracle play the most

53
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,360
important role in the sequence of events

54
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,479
which led to the fulfillment of its

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,880
prophecy for a time I thought that the

56
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,689
existence of the Oedipus effect

57
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,709
distinguished the social from the

58
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:46,560
natural sciences as to say the influence

59
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,209
of a prediction upon the event predicted

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,640
but in biology too he goes on even in

61
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:54,099
molecular biology expectations often

62
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,569
play a role in bringing about what has

63
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,189
been expected he doesn't actually

64
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,289
explain why he thinks that in molecular

65
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:00,759
biology and on the face of it it sounds

66
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:04,419
implausible in any case that's what he

67
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:06,129
says so having read Wikipedia then I had

68
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:09,039
a look at the poverty of historicism I

69
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:12,579
obtained the book and looked up the

70
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,500
Oedipus effect in the index so I'm going

71
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,380
to read you a few passages from the

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,620
crucial four or five pages so you will

73
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:23,019
have an idea pointers so as to lay mr.

74
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,420
cirrhosis idea of leisure activity out

75
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,670
in somebody else's words and then I'm

76
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,039
going to invite him to comment on how he

77
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:33,099
sees the notion which he has developed

78
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:35,949
in relation to these earlier ideas of

79
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:39,039
what sound to be similar ideas and I

80
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:41,139
must say I was quite struck by a Papa's

81
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,150
formulation of the idea so here's what

82
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,559
popper says in poverty of historicism

83
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,450
which I think came out sometime in the

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,129
1940s so quite a long time ago and

85
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,949
Robert Merton was writing around the

86
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:52,289
same time I so page 11

87
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:55,329
underneath under the heading

88
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:57,039
inexactitude of prediction the idea that

89
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,709
the prediction may have influence upon

90
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,269
the predicted event is a very old one he

91
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,700
posted in the legend killed his father

92
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,289
whom he had never seen before this was

93
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,789
the direct result of the prophecy which

94
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:09,310
had caused his father to abandon him

95
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:11,289
this is why I call I suggest the name

96
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,659
Oedipus effect the influence of the

97
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:15,429
prediction upon the predicted event or

98
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:17,680
more generally for the influence of an

99
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,900
item of information from the situation

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,049
to which the information refers whether

101
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,818
this influence

102
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:25,908
tends to bring about the predicted event

103
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:28,460
or whether it tends to prevent it he

104
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:30,680
calls it the intimus effect I think it

105
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:32,750
might be more aptly called the Macbeth

106
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,360
effect because of course as you remember

107
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:40,908
in that play the witch's prediction of

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,348
Macbeth's murder of the king is partly

109
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:43,699
at least what brings about the murder of

110
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,199
the king and many other things happening

111
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:47,658
in that story so we have a case of the

112
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,050
prediction influencing the course of

113
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:54,860
events so that's the first formulation a

114
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,509
little bit further at page 12 he says we

115
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,669
a fit is under the heading object

116
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:00,439
objectivity and valuation we are faced

117
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:02,598
with we are faced in the social sciences

118
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,240
with a full and complicated interaction

119
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:07,788
between observer and observed between

120
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,319
subject and object the awareness of the

121
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,389
existence of tendencies which might

122
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,340
produce a future event and furthermore

123
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,139
the awareness that the prediction might

124
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:16,728
itself and exert an influence on events

125
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,228
predicted it likely to have

126
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:20,598
repercussions on the content of the

127
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:22,490
prediction and the repercussions might

128
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:24,228
be of such a kind of gravely to impair

129
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,120
the objectivity of the predictions and

130
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:29,269
the weather results of research in the

131
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,129
social sciences a prediction is a social

132
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:33,168
happening which may interact with other

133
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:35,569
social happenings and among them with

134
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:37,310
the one which it predicts it may as we

135
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,348
have seen helped to precipitate this

136
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,930
event but it's easy to see that it may

137
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:44,089
also influence it it in other ways it

138
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,699
may in an extreme case even coarsely

139
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:48,468
happening it predicts the happening

140
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,870
might not have occurred at all if it had

141
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:53,329
not been predicted at the other extreme

142
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,399
the prediction of an impending event may

143
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:57,378
lead to its prevention so that by

144
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,568
deliberately or negligently abstaining

145
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:01,819
from predicting it the social scientist

146
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,528
it may be said could bring it about of

147
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,419
course it to happen there will clearly

148
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:07,728
be many intermediate cases between these

149
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:09,079
two extremes the action of predicting

150
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:11,718
something and that of abstaining from

151
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:16,250
prediction might both have all sorts of

152
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:21,528
consequences final brief quote the

153
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:23,509
interaction pronouncements and the sort

154
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:25,759
and social life almost invariably

155
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,288
creates situations which we have not

156
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,389
only to consider the truth of such

157
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:30,069
pronouncements but also their actual

158
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,620
influence

159
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,899
developments the social scientist may be

160
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,480
striving to find the truth but at the

161
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:40,089
same time he must always be exerting a

162
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,890
definite influence upon society the very

163
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:45,699
fact that his pronouncements do exert an

164
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:47,139
influence destroys their objectivity so

165
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,599
these ideas certainly sounds very much

166
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,909
in the same and same ballpark as we say

167
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,330
as mr. Soros his ideas so the first

168
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,230
thing I'll do before we turn to

169
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:59,439
questions from the audience is him

170
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:02,140
invite terms to saw us to to comment on

171
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,879
on this and how he sees the concept of

172
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:09,240
reflectivity that he's explained today

173
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:17,040
in relation to these earlier ideas again

174
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:23,079
first of all I think popper spoke mainly

175
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:25,180
reflexivity of social theories whereas I

176
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:30,519
emphasize the reflectivity of the

177
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:34,030
subject matter recognizers of course

178
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:36,159
also the reflectivity of social theories

179
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:41,339
but more important is that the

180
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:50,700
participants are engaged in reflexive

181
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:52,119
phenomena and of course sociology has

182
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,120
recognized

183
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,629
reflexivity as a social phenomenon and

184
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:03,840
Merton was definitely the path breaker

185
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:08,639
with the bandwagon effect and Andy and

186
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:13,029
self-fulfilling prophecies but economics

187
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,279
has gone out of its way to eliminate the

188
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:18,819
reflectivity from the subject matter and

189
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,279
we have paid a very heavy price account

190
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:25,599
you know amounting to trillions of

191
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:29,409
dollars for that little mistake so

192
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:33,009
that's I would say is the different the

193
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:36,490
other thing that I would point out that

194
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:39,720
this reflectivity as a phenomenon hasn't

195
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,840
been analyzed the way for instance

196
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,600
self-reference

197
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:47,110
with Bertrand Russell and Freya and so

198
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,879
on then I got onto reflectivity by

199
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,820
reading about self reference and

200
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:56,200
apparent paradox of the liar that's what

201
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:59,070
led beyond but then I discovered that it

202
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,670
is really a much more pervasive

203
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:08,290
phenomenon so I would say that's those

204
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:10,269
are the major differences and and you

205
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:14,879
know I I then broke down

206
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:18,129
reflexivity into the cognitive and

207
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:22,240
manipulative functions and argued that

208
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:26,639
the two functions interfere with each

209
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:30,190
other creating an element of uncertainty

210
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,379
which is a characteristic of human

211
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,560
affairs of course it's not the only one

212
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:38,350
and when it comes to uncertainty again

213
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:43,479
economic theory has gone overboard

214
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:46,300
trying to eliminate uncertainty but

215
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,950
there are of course very valuable

216
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:51,429
antecedents that I would quote

217
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:56,110
particularly night ninety and

218
00:09:51,429 --> 00:10:00,069
uncertainty which is basically what I am

219
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,840
harping on also I mean one thing you

220
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,240
didn't mention there worth mentioning I

221
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,790
think is now the popper no Merton saw

222
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,340
the application of reflexivity to the

223
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:11,079
behavior of financial markets since you

224
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,420
were a participant in financial markets

225
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,910
you applied it to there to that area

226
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:18,099
where it of course applies particularly

227
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:21,610
was spectacularly well right now there

228
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,930
which enables you to to understand okay

229
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:30,909
only know the particular irony is that

230
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:36,569
Robert Merton son got a Nobel price for

231
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:36,569
devising formula which ignored reflexive

232
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:43,259
okay now my my job is to throw the the

233
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,550
floor open to our

234
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,029
ensign was supposed to take questions

235
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:50,099
first from the remote audience at the

236
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:51,809
London School of Economics first like

237
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,250
three questions from them before we move

238
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:59,399
to people here and let me say before

239
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:02,370
getting questions from the LSE that I

240
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,799
would implore questioners to first of

241
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:08,009
all identify themselves by name and

242
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,379
affiliation then to make their questions

243
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:12,899
concise and to speak as clearly as

244
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,179
possible cuz we're hearing them here and

245
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:18,899
to make their questions questions not

246
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:21,089
speeches so a question to mr. Soros

247
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,590
concisely stated and clearly articulated

248
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:28,170
would be greatly appreciated with that I

249
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:37,530
open the floor to the élysée now we wait

250
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:42,569
for moderator in London - can you hear

251
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:46,259
us yes hello George we very much enjoyed

252
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:49,110
your lecture and we have actually three

253
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:52,259
I hope for questions if we can fit it in

254
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:55,680
in ten minutes so I'm going to hand it

255
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:58,850
over to the first path we hello my name

256
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:01,588
is Zachary myself we leave

257
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,870
but a master student and international

258
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,820
political economy Jared Elysee I was

259
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,919
interested in how a third party could

260
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,170
become aware of a reflexive relationship

261
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,000
and how they could sort of interact in

262
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,439
order to gain from the information they

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,259
learn about the existence of that

264
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,630
relationship and an applied example of

265
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,819
that with our applied question would be

266
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:23,278
how would a government become aware of a

267
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,589
positive reflexive relationship and

268
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,360
intervene in financial markets in order

269
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:31,640
to dampen the boom-bust cycle that

270
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:35,970
results as a consequence of reflexivity

271
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:41,309
okay I have some fortunately difficulty

272
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:44,129
hearing it can't can Mary perhaps you

273
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:46,349
could just repeat the question because I

274
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:52,759
have difficulty hearing it I could hear

275
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,759
it yeah what could you repeat a mission

276
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,179
in a reflexive relationship and in

277
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,879
particular the role of a government

278
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:06,208
could the government identify a

279
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,278
reflexive participation a reflexive

280
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:13,949
relationship that in fact be reflexive

281
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:21,929
itself in order to dampen down boom-bust

282
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:27,930
cycles did you hear that Daniel can you

283
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:30,299
hear me only just nothing I'm making it

284
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:34,879
simpler and simpler he put it very well

285
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:37,809
how can a third party influence a

286
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:44,289
two-party reflexive relation

287
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:49,768
and how can a government intervene using

288
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:54,120
your theory to stop a boom-bust cycle

289
00:13:49,769 --> 00:14:00,159
did you hear that how can government

290
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:04,198
agency industry well of course this

291
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:08,100
question leads up to tomorrow's lecture

292
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:14,588
that's exactly what I will discuss

293
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:20,740
tomorrow but let me just preface it

294
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:24,639
perhaps but by saying that regulators

295
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:30,009
and government and financial authorities

296
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:34,269
also are subject to the same limits of

297
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:39,120
phal ability as market participants so

298
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:42,220
you have a constant interplay between

299
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,230
regulators and market participants but

300
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:49,990
both sides operate with imperfect

301
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:53,829
understanding and that's what makes the

302
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:57,419
process is so interesting but I will

303
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:57,419
deal with that more tomorrow

304
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,490
fortunately we're not going to hear you

305
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,759
tomorrow but perhaps we can tell us when

306
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:12,690
you next come to Elysee I'm handing over

307
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,129
to the next question hi thank you for

308
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,240
sharing your insights today my name is

309
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:20,279
jawad katya and i am a part-time finance

310
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,399
student masters and a full-time

311
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:26,009
proprietary trader and my question to

312
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,559
you is you talked a little bit about how

313
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:31,049
your general theory relates to trend

314
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,899
following and charting in general and

315
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:36,389
how much you may have or may not have

316
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:40,039
used these sorts of strategies in their

317
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:43,889
own trading thank you well again

318
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:45,569
obviously being at the School of

319
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:50,029
Economics you are particularly

320
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:59,400
interested in financial markets and and

321
00:15:50,029 --> 00:16:06,259
that's again ten following I could

322
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:12,959
answer in general terms that actually

323
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:16,259
trends tend to validate themselves - for

324
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:22,730
an extended period and therefore trend

325
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:26,909
following is very often a valid strategy

326
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:29,940
which contradicts let's say the the

327
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:35,689
prevailing paradigm of efficient market

328
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,690
and rational expectations however

329
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:39,049
reality

330
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:49,798
may not fulfill the expectations that

331
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:54,749
are involved in that trend and then you

332
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:57,058
you you reach a point where the trend is

333
00:16:54,749 --> 00:17:01,100
reversed and you don't want to be a

334
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:01,100
trend follower at that time

335
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:13,100
third question hi I'm corner hi Johnny

336
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:16,669
and I'm an undergraduate student

337
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:19,398
studying social policy my question to

338
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:21,770
you is how do you feel about the fact

339
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:24,558
that Adam Smith is known to be the

340
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:27,078
father of economics for his theories on

341
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,960
the invisible hand when market

342
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:34,730
fundamentalism is an economic policy you

343
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:37,370
criticize the most thank you again I

344
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,470
didn't understand that passion I think

345
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:41,719
the question was how do you feel about

346
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,440
Adam Smith as the father of economics

347
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,460
and the inventor of the invisible hand

348
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:53,058
in light of your theory of reflexivity

349
00:17:48,460 --> 00:18:03,950
well you know Adam Smith wrote two books

350
00:17:53,058 --> 00:18:06,500
I haven't read either of them and I am a

351
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:14,480
critical of the invisible hand actually

352
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:22,159
it it markers actually perform a very

353
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:29,149
valuable function but they only are

354
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:33,700
designed to allow individuals to fulfill

355
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:38,629
their individual needs and there are

356
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:43,009
social issues like for instance a

357
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:48,640
regulation of markets that markets are

358
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:52,009
not designed to to solve or to deal with

359
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,778
so behind the invisible hand of the

360
00:18:52,009 --> 00:19:00,859
market there is hidden the visible hand

361
00:18:56,778 --> 00:19:04,429
of politics and that visible hand is

362
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:09,079
deliberately obscured by market

363
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:15,980
fundamentalists who extol the virtues of

364
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:18,000
the markets forgetting or of obfuscating

365
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,210
the fact

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,839
that behind the market mechanism there

367
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:32,600
are political decisions that are then

368
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:36,750
determining how markets function I will

369
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:39,869
again you are anticipating actually this

370
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:43,259
happens to be the fourth lecture where I

371
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:47,159
will talk about market values and and

372
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:50,910
social values and the conflict between

373
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:55,730
capitalism and open society but I'm

374
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:58,890
happy to anticipate that that subject

375
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,950
I'm surprised that nobody from the LSE

376
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:04,560
wants to ask a question of mr. Soros

377
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,029
about Papa's philosophy versus his

378
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,679
philosophy because after all this is

379
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:09,720
where Karl Popper was a professor but

380
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,060
there are no questions about the

381
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,730
philosophical content of what mr. Soros

382
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:16,649
said in relation to to Papa but maybe

383
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,420
later we can come back to LSE but I

384
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:22,009
think now I will throw the questions

385
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,600
open to the audience present before us

386
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:29,549
so anybody with hands up and then we

387
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:31,500
proceed yes and I think you need to get

388
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:39,269
a microphone from somebody unless I

389
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:43,380
don't know was be happy I would like to

390
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:48,629
know what's the effect the role of an

391
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:54,930
educator in society as in the perfect

392
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:59,040
CVT effect for one side a high educated

393
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:06,660
a society each person has a bigger

394
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:10,500
effect but another side and educated the

395
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:13,640
society is more rational and perhaps a

396
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:19,289
more rational society the reflexivity

397
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:26,009
effect is is more anyway what's the role

398
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:29,039
of education of a society to have a

399
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:38,579
bigger or smaller

400
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:42,279
detractor well Christopher market is is

401
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:45,309
from Brazil and he was Minister of

402
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:51,480
Education and he introduced he

403
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:57,069
introduced ball sized koala which is

404
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:59,529
actually a payment to poor families to

405
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:02,139
allow their children to attend school

406
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:04,930
and I think it was it's a wonderful

407
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:11,530
scheme and has made it big difference in

408
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:16,060
Brazil and it has been imitated in other

409
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:18,430
countries not notably Mexico and I'm

410
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:22,539
actually a great supporter of that

411
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:28,390
scheme we introduced a variant of it in

412
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:31,359
New York about which I am not so not so

413
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:40,870
entirely happy but I'm supporting it

414
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:47,579
also and obviously education is a most

415
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:47,579
important for for an open society and

416
00:22:48,240 --> 00:23:02,140
the altogether I think that if people

417
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:07,180
citizens would understand the

418
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,730
limitations of our ability to deal with

419
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:15,220
social problems if they understood

420
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:20,890
refractivity actually we could deal with

421
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:25,230
our social problems better so most of my

422
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:31,390
philosophy has a kind of a negative

423
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:33,910
thing or to it namely imperfect

424
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:38,490
understanding and and

425
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:45,610
and fallibilities there's all sound very

426
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:50,230
bad but in effect if you if you

427
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:58,049
understand it and and if you are in a

428
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:58,049
better position to improve your policies

429
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:10,049
perfection it can be the bane of of

430
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:15,880
social reform in the French Revolution

431
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:25,569
people believing in reason engaged in

432
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:28,870
terror the various ideologies which

433
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:32,759
claim to be in possession of the

434
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:39,129
ultimate truth it could be only imposed

435
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:43,839
by force so I think if we understand our

436
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:49,230
limitations and you return it around and

437
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:54,129
and what is imperfect can be improved so

438
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:56,500
we are in a way fortunate at that with

439
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:02,170
our fail ability because that leaves

440
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:05,259
infinite scope for for improvement we

441
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:09,370
won't solve all our problems we leave

442
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:11,799
some for the next generations to come so

443
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:15,250
some education should teach uncertainty

444
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:20,559
of the dogma right and I've been arguing

445
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:23,980
also that we ought to pass from the age

446
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:27,339
of reason to the age of faith ability

447
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:32,470
that it's a less a an achievement of

448
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:33,480
reason to understand fail ability okay

449
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,529
who's next

450
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,529
yes gentlemen middle level

451
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:48,599
better wait for ya thank you hello I'm

452
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:51,599
Robert Oracle from Mexico

453
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:54,719
I studied MBA in the CEO Business School

454
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:58,589
my question is well it's been said that

455
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,839
the 20th century was the physics century

456
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:05,009
and what and well this century will be

457
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:09,808
the biology century will be the biology

458
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:16,019
biology and biology and there is a

459
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:18,599
hypothesis that telling us that all the

460
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:21,649
sciences will come closer together do

461
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,109
you think this threatened threatens your

462
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:29,428
your own hypothesis or your own proposal

463
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:33,778
that we should separate the social

464
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:35,730
sciences from the Natural Sciences well

465
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:37,409
I think this question is if you didn't

466
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,298
say much about biology did allude to it

467
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:41,009
at one point because you have the

468
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:43,048
separation between the social sciences

469
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:44,399
and the Natural Sciences is bringing up

470
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:47,128
the point that biology is becoming

471
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:49,199
central and so he was wondering where

472
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:51,418
the biology threatens the dichotomy that

473
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,788
you have because it seems to involve

474
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:55,620
Sasa studying the social insects for

475
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:56,878
example to write that kind of issue I

476
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:00,569
think that's what it was yeah no

477
00:26:56,878 --> 00:27:05,569
actually one of the one of the questions

478
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:11,210
that I struggle with is how does

479
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:15,628
reflectivity relate to complexity

480
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:19,679
because that's it evolutionary Systems

481
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:23,069
Theory has great similarities with

482
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:29,309
reflectivity in the sense that it does

483
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:35,779
not have a determinate outcome and it

484
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:42,240
evolves and I think that the

485
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:47,579
the two are in a way quite close to each

486
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:50,819
other in the sense that systems

487
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:55,879
evolutionary Systems Theory network

488
00:27:50,819 --> 00:28:00,899
theory has relevance to human society

489
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:03,750
which is also a kind of network so

490
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:08,009
that's a general rules about network

491
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:10,440
theory apply to actually to financial

492
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:11,129
markets to banks because banks were

493
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:17,539
networks

494
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:21,630
and you had contagion destroying the

495
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:26,579
financial system similar to to a viral

496
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:30,410
attack so let's say epidemiology has a

497
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:33,779
relevance and which we ignored and which

498
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:37,080
which people are now aware of and we are

499
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:40,490
now looking at the at at those issues so

500
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:47,149
there are things to be learnt from

501
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:50,970
biology and and and other networks

502
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:54,769
however I think reflexivity which has

503
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:58,460
which has to do with the specific

504
00:28:54,769 --> 00:29:04,429
relationship between thinking and

505
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:07,640
reality that's a specifically human

506
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:12,890
characteristic there is it applies to

507
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:16,470
human societies it may apply to whales

508
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:19,320
because whales seem to be able to

509
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:22,740
communicate and there are some evidence

510
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:27,139
that actually pretty pretty elaborate

511
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:31,319
societies but so I'm not I don't want to

512
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:34,130
delimit it purely to human society but

513
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:38,869
even there we probably

514
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:41,390
more and more relevant the content of

515
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:43,609
our thinking is probably more relevant

516
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:47,120
to our problems that the thinking of

517
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:50,529
Wales is is to our problems so that's

518
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:55,279
why I think reflexivity throws light on

519
00:29:50,529 --> 00:30:00,019
the human condition and that's how I see

520
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,059
the the to relate to each other and

521
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:03,740
presumably our primate ancestors will

522
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:05,389
have reflexive relations well they've

523
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,880
won one of the things another is about

524
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:10,700
to take over their place as the other if

525
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,980
I described if I described marriage as a

526
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:23,779
reflexive relationship then certainly

527
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:25,490
monkeys would qualify for okay thank you

528
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:28,700
very much my name is Fernando shmita and

529
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:31,549
ambassador of Chile I see a lot of South

530
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,140
American people here well my question is

531
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:37,089
very simple can you elaborate a little

532
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:43,240
bit more on reflexivity reflexivity and

533
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:49,039
emotions well certainly

534
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:52,430
first of all reason and emotion are in

535
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:59,000
act inescapably connected that's one of

536
00:30:52,430 --> 00:31:04,960
the discoveries of brain science which

537
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,869
confirms humans contention so so this

538
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:18,410
concept of the disembodied intellect was

539
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:22,189
a I think is currently superseded but it

540
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:28,600
isn't purely emotion that kind of

541
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:35,980
interferes with reason they're on our

542
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:40,250
rational problems in reflexive

543
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:43,509
situations so for instance because of

544
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:47,200
this force

545
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:50,890
dichotomy between reason and emotion and

546
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:55,140
his concept of disembodied intellect and

547
00:31:50,890 --> 00:32:01,480
rational behavior Alan Greenspan

548
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:10,300
described bubbles the specifically the

549
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:14,140
the IT of all the the technology bubble

550
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:19,059
as irrational exuberance his famous

551
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:26,020
words that he applied in 1996 well it

552
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:29,169
missed describes bubbles because if I as

553
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:35,829
a market participant see a bubble coming

554
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:38,820
I buy because that's the profitable

555
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:43,299
thing the rational thing to do and that

556
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:48,639
creates bubbles so you can't rely on

557
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:51,970
markets to prevent asset bubbles from

558
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:56,470
forming and therefore he was wrong to

559
00:32:51,970 --> 00:33:03,029
describe it as irrational and in fact

560
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:06,700
you can't account on rational behavior

561
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:09,639
preventing bubbles so that's a problem

562
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:12,840
that needs to be solved and actually

563
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:16,960
requires the regulators to accept

564
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:21,599
responsibility for preventing asset

565
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,759
bubbles from growing too large so a

566
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:27,819
misinterpretation of what bubbles are or

567
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:32,170
how financial markets operate lead to

568
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:34,059
the wrong policies so emotions may be

569
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:36,670
involved in the Flexi situation but it's

570
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:39,369
not necessarily it's not emotion it's

571
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:42,370
not because it's fear and greed it's in

572
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:46,989
the nature as I will try to explain

573
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:49,149
tomorrow why and how it is in the nature

574
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:54,099
of financial markets that they are

575
00:33:49,150 --> 00:34:04,509
bubble prone not equilibrium bound

576
00:33:54,099 --> 00:34:07,459
okay who's next gentleman front row oh I

577
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:09,858
miss you student and a mistress today

578
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,409
what is the secret of your financial

579
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:16,329
success in reflect of your family story

580
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:19,250
thank you sorry

581
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:26,569
goodnight bit what is my to come up and

582
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:29,719
maybe can you say it again what is the

583
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:33,530
secret of your financial success in

584
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:39,858
reflect of your family story thank you

585
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:46,269
I would say that recognizing that I may

586
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:46,269
be wrong as simple as that

587
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:53,798
shall we move to the gentleman here yes

588
00:34:55,568 --> 00:35:09,769
delighted to see you I speak into this

589
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:12,139
should we conclude that there are no

590
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:16,579
real lessons from history but only

591
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:18,889
subjective interpretations no I know I

592
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:21,318
don't know how you reach that conclusion

593
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:28,038
from what I said because it cannot be

594
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:31,900
tested about but about I was arguing

595
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:37,309
that the methods of natural science as

596
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:41,059
described so elegantly by offer to not

597
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:43,130
apply to the study of history it doesn't

598
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:45,829
mean that we cannot study history that

599
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:53,559
you cannot learn lessons that we can't

600
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:59,470
make reasonable contingent predictions

601
00:35:53,559 --> 00:36:05,589
but not by this methods which produce

602
00:35:59,469 --> 00:36:09,980
timelessly valid universally valid laws

603
00:36:05,588 --> 00:36:14,269
history is one direction it's not

604
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:17,510
timeless it's time bound and when you

605
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:21,588
start with that then you need different

606
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:25,490
methods for studying historical

607
00:36:21,588 --> 00:36:28,900
processes and I will argue in subsequent

608
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:31,909
lectures that economic theory as such

609
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:35,599
takes the wrong approach because it

610
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:40,489
looks for these universally valid laws

611
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:44,450
like if you have in physics whereas you

612
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:46,219
really need to study markets in the

613
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:50,179
financial markets and financial

614
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:55,189
processes in a context and you have to

615
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:57,139
recognize that conditions change and and

616
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:04,519
actually don't

617
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:13,098
repeat themselves maybe in the middle

618
00:37:04,518 --> 00:37:14,899
there I need a good way for the mic my

619
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:16,460
name is catalina akash and i'm a

620
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,700
professor of philosophy here at the

621
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:22,730
Central European University my question

622
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:25,778
is related exactly to this last point

623
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:29,719
that you made as you emphasize that

624
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:31,730
poppers theory of falsification was an

625
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:34,429
explanation of how science can be both

626
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:37,369
empirical and rational because we have

627
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:40,068
the universal laws we create a test

628
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:43,369
situation and if there is a falsifying

629
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:46,730
instance we can give up the law and they

630
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:48,650
on the basis of what you said we cannot

631
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:51,199
apply the same apparatus in these social

632
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:54,139
sciences because we cannot aim to have

633
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:56,719
universal laws so I was wondering how do

634
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:59,328
you think we can hold up social sciences

635
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:04,239
to the requirements of being rational

636
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:09,140
and empirical you see I think that

637
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:14,419
social science can produce universally

638
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:20,028
valid laws but those laws don't

639
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:23,960
determine the course of events so for

640
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:26,960
instance I think I put forward the human

641
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:31,970
uncertainty principle as a universally

642
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:35,298
valid hypothesis and I believe it is

643
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:39,649
actually universally valid but by its

644
00:38:35,298 --> 00:38:45,139
very nature it doesn't determine it

645
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:49,630
cannot determine how markets whether

646
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:56,859
that's if financial markets or or

647
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:58,390
or history is going to evolve in other

648
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:06,880
words human behavior is unpredictable

649
00:38:58,389 --> 00:39:09,659
and that's the law yes yes yes but there

650
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,090
are actually some for instance

651
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:16,029
statistical generalizations I mean I I

652
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:19,150
will distinguish between near

653
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:21,970
equilibrium conditions and far from

654
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:24,490
equilibrium conditions and it is in the

655
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:28,509
nature near equilibrium conditions that

656
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:31,989
you can make statistical generalizations

657
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:34,660
and you can calculate risk on that basis

658
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:38,169
however in far from equilibrium

659
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:43,259
conditions that particular method is

660
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:46,630
going to and lend you in difficulties

661
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,330
because those things that apply in near

662
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,400
equilibrium don't apply and far from

663
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:57,969
equilibrium condition that's another

664
00:39:51,400 --> 00:40:01,349
generalization here is the question from

665
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:04,539
this side even microphone over here yeah

666
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:06,299
no that's okay there's a yeah Julia sort

667
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:10,389
of our Economics Department see you

668
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,880
first question mr. surage is your

669
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:15,069
opinion or understanding of popper

670
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,340
changing as time goes by

671
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:20,800
are you more critical or more supportive

672
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:24,039
now as you were let's say in the 50s you

673
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,680
mentioned during your student years and

674
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:30,039
second question is that let me answer

675
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:33,669
that because I forget advocated by my

676
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:36,219
opinion of popper is evolving I have

677
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:38,590
become more critical of him as time went

678
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:47,108
on and of course he's not around to

679
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:49,999
defend himself which is but also

680
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:52,159
actually in preparing these lectures I

681
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:55,879
went a little too far in criticizing

682
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:59,239
popper and then I had to revise it

683
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:02,709
because because he actually for instance

684
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:07,298
and did recognize reflexivity

685
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:11,239
he only applied it to social sciences

686
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:14,150
but if pressed he would he would

687
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:18,170
certainly agree that it also applies

688
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:24,920
even with greater force to two

689
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:30,979
participants so but as you will hear in

690
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:41,829
subsequent lectures he took it for

691
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:45,169
granted that the purpose of thinking of

692
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:48,439
discourse is to get closer to the truth

693
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,469
and that's a false assumption it's a

694
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:54,228
it's what I call the Enlightenment

695
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:59,150
fallacy and and I of course he was a

696
00:41:54,228 --> 00:42:02,118
critic of many of the excessive claims

697
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:07,729
for reason and nevertheless he and me

698
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:13,039
too fell into that trap and it has

699
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:15,739
forced me to modify my concept of open

700
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:19,519
society which I had adopted from him

701
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:22,338
these the second question oh we

702
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:26,028
understand that your critical position

703
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:28,429
towards the mainstream which basically

704
00:42:26,028 --> 00:42:31,219
rules maybe from the from the late

705
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:35,209
seventies or this time period but the

706
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:38,329
question would be if it is relevant

707
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:40,009
which economic school you feel close to

708
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:42,528
because there is a you know a huge

709
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:44,659
number of schools not only what you call

710
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:47,478
you know know this this fundamental is

711
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:49,828
market fundamentalism you feel closer to

712
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:53,159
Schumpeter higher Keynes

713
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:55,229
night you mentioned thank you I was

714
00:42:53,159 --> 00:43:01,259
definitely very much influenced by

715
00:42:55,228 --> 00:43:03,629
Keynes and and I think that of course

716
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:06,588
he'd lived at a particular moment in

717
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,950
history where he had to deal with

718
00:43:06,588 --> 00:43:10,048
incipient

719
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:13,468
with the problems of depression and

720
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:15,838
therefore he neglected the problems of

721
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:18,838
inflation but had he lived at a

722
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:22,498
different time I'm sure that he would

723
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:26,518
have been also his analysis would have

724
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:28,798
extended also to analysis of inflation

725
00:43:26,518 --> 00:43:32,909
because of them because of that he

726
00:43:28,798 --> 00:43:39,119
became discredited in the 70s when

727
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:43,288
inflation was the dominant problem of of

728
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:47,489
the time so I would say that I was I

729
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:51,630
would consider myself a follower of

730
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:55,259
games the same way as I'm a follower of

731
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:58,469
popper without necessarily agreeing with

732
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:59,818
everything they said that let me add to

733
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,599
what you were saying implies the first

734
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:02,639
question there

735
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:06,028
of course poppers name for reflectivity

736
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,558
the oedipus effect only tells you he

737
00:44:06,028 --> 00:44:09,420
would have agreed that it can occur

738
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:11,039
between individuals because that was one

739
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,048
prediction about a particular man's

740
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,660
future action wasn't a social science

741
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:16,920
theory influencing rings so he obviously

742
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:18,808
would have agreed with the general

743
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,489
notion I think he was discussing he

744
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:21,599
doesn't he I think his if he was going

745
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:24,420
to give a name to I think he would have

746
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,499
called it interactivity not reflectivity

747
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,838
I think an element that you've

748
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:30,448
emphasized that he doesn't emphasize is

749
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,308
a positive feedback aspect he doesn't

750
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:34,889
ever make the point there that I make

751
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:36,630
the prediction of the event I change the

752
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:38,368
event that I predict and then that must

753
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,920
change the way I see the world he

754
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:42,749
doesn't see that with that circular

755
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,309
causation that you emphasize that's the

756
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:45,088
thing he doesn't he doesn't pick up I

757
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:47,819
think on that point

758
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:52,619
yeah who's like I can't see everybody so

759
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:54,889
clearly the su4 yes microphones coming

760
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,890
from

761
00:44:55,809 --> 00:45:00,170
I'm Rahman Friedman professor of

762
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:04,940
economics at New York University

763
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:09,769
I have a couple of questions that limit

764
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:11,780
myself to two the first one is that I

765
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:15,920
think what gives reflects I just want to

766
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:19,970
comment on it you emphasize reflexivity

767
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,980
and there's a certain tension in your

768
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:26,389
writing and even in this speech about

769
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:30,139
the status of fallibility I wanted to

770
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:33,739
ask you where the fallibility in your

771
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:37,099
mind is necessary for objectivity to

772
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:40,789
have the force availability fallibility

773
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:43,880
being absolutely central and I wanted to

774
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:46,489
up Kent there's a the chairman's of the

775
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,960
spirit clearly indicated no speeches I

776
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:51,169
will give no speech I just want to

777
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,840
signal what I mean is that if there was

778
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:56,539
a mechanical connection between reality

779
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:01,250
and thinking and back to reality that's

780
00:45:56,539 --> 00:46:03,679
reflexive that certainly would not be

781
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:05,840
something that would yield to the kind

782
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:09,079
of conclusions that you draw in the real

783
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,380
world context and that's where that

784
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:16,909
flexibility is actually quite different

785
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:18,559
from popper from from from from Merton

786
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:21,019
it's very different than a

787
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:23,389
self-fulfilling prophecy that has a

788
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:26,150
vague notion but that suggests such a

789
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:27,739
mechanical connection first I will want

790
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,019
to give a comment on the second question

791
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:33,589
that is directly in my mind related to

792
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:36,380
this which was us actually a phenomenal

793
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:39,019
question about educational reflexivity

794
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:46,970
by the gentleman from Brazil because

795
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:51,199
that question suggests one one wonders

796
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:52,309
whether it is complexity that underpins

797
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:56,539
reflexivity

798
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:59,239
my conjecture here I have some thoughts

799
00:46:56,539 --> 00:47:01,028
on that is that it is exactly the way

800
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:04,298
Colleen just said that the very

801
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:06,608
this change and it's actually a non

802
00:47:04,298 --> 00:47:10,659
routine change that is crucial for

803
00:47:06,608 --> 00:47:13,418
reflexivity to have this force and you

804
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:16,298
can yes when you have education as Kane

805
00:47:13,418 --> 00:47:18,068
said we can do more in understanding

806
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:20,259
things but at some point we're going to

807
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:22,808
reach the limit for it because there is

808
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:25,059
a question of non routine change that

809
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:29,729
will also that will always prevent a

810
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:35,169
complete understanding and therefore

811
00:47:29,728 --> 00:47:38,889
reflectivities and is a is a property of

812
00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:42,219
social systems to me and infallible 'ti

813
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:43,808
that are properties in principle these

814
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:46,229
are not properties that could be

815
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:49,179
eliminated with tank that can only be

816
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:51,399
eliminated if change in the world sees

817
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:53,019
which of course you have understood in

818
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,159
your understanding of the social systems

819
00:47:53,018 --> 00:47:56,678
closed versus open

820
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,179
that's why reflexivity to me so that

821
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:00,219
this is basically a set of issues is

822
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:04,088
that flexibility really delay the

823
00:48:00,219 --> 00:48:09,009
complexity rather than change and and

824
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:12,119
things that relate professor of course

825
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:19,559
tell ability is absolutely essential

826
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:21,059
it's a universal human condition and the

827
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:26,048
reflexivity

828
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:33,189
is a two-way connection between a biased

829
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:38,909
/ misconceptions and say the objective

830
00:48:33,188 --> 00:48:42,098
reality and there are ways in which

831
00:48:38,909 --> 00:48:43,390
misconceptions can actually change the

832
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:46,689
objective conditions

833
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:48,788
that's reflectivity but in order to have

834
00:48:46,688 --> 00:48:52,658
life activity you must have the

835
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:55,059
misconceptions or the bias view to start

836
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:58,340
with otherwise you wouldn't have the

837
00:48:55,059 --> 00:49:03,110
two-way connection so

838
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:06,680
it replaces this strange concoction of

839
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:11,740
perfect knowledge that is characteristic

840
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:20,869
of the prevailing dogma in in in

841
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:23,149
economics so that's in complexity yeah

842
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:30,409
Roman was asking about well you see this

843
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:33,789
is this is a issue that as I say I only

844
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:36,279
have a tentative answer at the moment

845
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:39,550
actually

846
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:43,370
reflexivity doesn't need to be complex

847
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:46,070
you see and therefore you can't say that

848
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:48,469
it's the same thing because actually

849
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:53,480
that flexibility can be something very

850
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:56,959
very simple like an enmity between

851
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:59,240
people where one person says to the

852
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,699
other you are my enemy and lo and behold

853
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:03,949
he is your enemy that's not that's not

854
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:06,769
complex I think what what other lives

855
00:50:03,949 --> 00:50:08,629
reflexivity is awareness that i can be

856
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:11,269
aware of your attitudes towards me and

857
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,650
that can change myself but of course

858
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:15,019
when you're looking at the natural world

859
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:17,329
it's not aware of your your attitudes or

860
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:19,250
predictions about it Halley's Comet or

861
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:21,170
the motions of the planets so they can't

862
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:23,179
be influenced by our beliefs about them

863
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:24,710
but as humans we can be aware of other

864
00:50:23,179 --> 00:50:26,449
people's beliefs about us as they

865
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,920
express them in statements and then that

866
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:29,989
can change us as a result of it

867
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,970
and it's so that I think is what new

868
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:34,849
facility comes from consciousness

869
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:37,699
awareness yes of others there's one

870
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:42,460
other point with regard to education you

871
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:46,179
see while education is a wonderful thing

872
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,179
it doesn't necessarily

873
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:57,339
give you very good results because

874
00:50:52,139 --> 00:51:01,119
reality can be manipulated and and if

875
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:04,600
you are good at manipulating reality you

876
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:07,299
can get better results but how you

877
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:11,920
manipulate what your objectives are

878
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:15,150
depend on your values and values are

879
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:19,320
particularly how shall I say

880
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:23,440
questionable in others there is no one

881
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:29,680
set of values that you can say that's

882
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:33,900
good so so we have done a lot as a

883
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:38,259
foundation in the way of Education and

884
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:41,410
and sometimes we have educated very

885
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:45,820
clever manipulators of public opinion

886
00:51:41,409 --> 00:51:48,339
who then used it to for very different

887
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:53,170
purposes for which I would have liked

888
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:57,670
them to use it I was a lady in the third

889
00:51:53,170 --> 00:52:00,639
world a as a margaret de heinrich and

890
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:03,190
the one word that keeps popping up in my

891
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:06,069
mind from the very beginning of your

892
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:08,200
talk is instinct and professors what you

893
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,760
were talking about alluding to awareness

894
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:12,039
and of course that's the same thing and

895
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,040
you're someone mr. Soros has been

896
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:17,380
enormous ly successful and I imagine in

897
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:21,779
some part because of your natural

898
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:25,510
instinct and the question is if you're

899
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:27,220
sharing the concept of reflexivity with

900
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:31,630
so many people if they don't possess

901
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:33,730
that natural god-given gift of instinct

902
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:39,190
how can they truly take reflexivity

903
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:41,469
and use it to its full power I don't get

904
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:44,470
the question do well like I think the

905
00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:46,089
question is you you have this conceptual

906
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:50,019
idea of reflexivity which you've applied

907
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:52,329
in your business life and could other

908
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:54,579
people have had the same success just by

909
00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:55,420
taking over the idea or was it more to

910
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:56,980
do with

911
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,519
factors about you than just having that

912
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:06,219
theory I think that was the fourth

913
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:07,480
question well I mean we all we all have

914
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:08,709
the theory now we're not all

915
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:15,639
successfully yep

916
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:20,409
well look it's it's obviously it's not

917
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:23,828
sufficient really it's it's it's been

918
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:29,739
useful but it didn't determine the

919
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:33,400
outcome and but the fact is that at the

920
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:37,509
time when I first started using those

921
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:40,769
ideas they did give me a leg up in the

922
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:46,260
financial markets because people were

923
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:49,989
most other players in the market were

924
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:56,710
guided by other ideas

925
00:53:49,989 --> 00:54:01,419
so however people did read my book so

926
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:05,710
I've lost that that that that edge that

927
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:07,690
I had yeah yeah it enables you to

928
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:09,940
predict bubbles movie it enables you to

929
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:11,588
predict bubbles more easily but you know

930
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:14,740
they're they're saying that economists

931
00:54:11,588 --> 00:54:18,068
have predicted eight of the last three

932
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:25,479
recessions well I predicted eight of the

933
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:28,058
next three bubbles about Howard Robinson

934
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:35,789
in there in front he needs a microphone

935
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:35,790
I think any microphone nearby okay

936
00:54:38,528 --> 00:54:42,920
this would be a philosophical question

937
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:44,419
I'm sure I was going to say I'm glasses

938
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,789
you're straight philosophical question

939
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:48,889
I'm afraid what do you think the

940
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:51,170
connection of your doctrine of

941
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:54,078
reflexivity is this old-fashioned

942
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:56,720
chestnut of free will does it follow

943
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,369
from what you said that there could not

944
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:00,828
be a deterministic account of human

945
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:04,548
behavior because in some sense or other

946
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:06,318
there are no definite facts about human

947
00:55:04,548 --> 00:55:08,420
psychology or what people are going to

948
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,679
do these are not the kind of things that

949
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,990
we put into the natural laws and

950
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:14,210
therefore they determinism must be false

951
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:15,558
and got a libertarian free will must be

952
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,889
right or don't you want to go in and

953
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:21,190
down that road well we had a very

954
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:24,558
interesting discussion last night about

955
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:28,010
determinism and in free will and I would

956
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:31,910
take the position that that both are

957
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:40,190
half right and if you put them together

958
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:46,420
you actually get the reality to to think

959
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:52,460
of of free will as being absolutely free

960
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:58,338
is to me even more distorted than to

961
00:55:52,460 --> 00:56:04,039
claim that human affairs are determined

962
00:55:58,338 --> 00:56:09,230
by universally valid laws I mean there

963
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:13,819
are of course not not all of reality can

964
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:19,000
be manipulated there is you know there

965
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:25,869
are the laws of physics that that

966
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,869
prevail so you may be extremely good at

967
00:56:26,139 --> 00:56:36,440
turning reality manipulating reality but

968
00:56:31,699 --> 00:56:39,288
Indian reality has the last word and you

969
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:42,679
want to be dead now that's something for

970
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:44,970
instance you cannot manipulate a way

971
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:47,789
even though we have developed

972
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:56,039
all kinds of myths to deal with this

973
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:58,469
rather unpalatable prospect hmm well no

974
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:05,779
deterministic laws are psychology itself

975
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:09,509
well I mean I would say that that Freud

976
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:14,970
identified maybe certain people who are

977
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:21,420
a bear sick in the sense that they their

978
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:29,848
actions are determined by their in a fix

979
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:34,079
their their their preconceived ideas but

980
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:41,640
a well functioning human being has to be

981
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:43,108
influenced by his by reality yes and I

982
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:44,789
think your position is that the world is

983
00:57:43,108 --> 00:57:46,049
half determined and the will is half

984
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:47,730
free hmm

985
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:50,730
the world is half determined and the

986
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:51,990
human will is half free okay she said it

987
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,990
was half to each of them was half true

988
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:56,338
who's next

989
00:57:53,989 --> 00:57:57,659
something something more philosophical

990
00:57:56,338 --> 00:58:00,358
would be welcome if there was something

991
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:05,338
yes go to the back iron you want to go

992
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:07,348
back one page okay he's got the

993
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:11,639
microphone of the Lancer right he's got

994
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:14,430
a microphone there hello thank you I am

995
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:17,909
Rodrigo from Mexico I am a student of

996
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:19,710
public policy at CU and first just to

997
00:58:17,909 --> 00:58:22,469
say that I'm very grateful it's being a

998
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:25,230
very enriching experience being in in

999
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:27,379
this University in this environment and

1000
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:32,280
I would like to ask you

1001
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:36,539
Plato another philosopher had a negative

1002
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:39,630
vision of time or an idea that time had

1003
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:44,130
the generative effect over things of

1004
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:48,960
reality on the other hand the paradigm

1005
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:53,070
of modernity presents more of a faith in

1006
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:56,559
progress conviction that the future will

1007
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:59,230
be better than than the present

1008
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,599
what do you think is this a Byzantine

1009
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:04,059
discussion a pointless discussion or you

1010
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,099
have understanding point what's the time

1011
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:10,809
what's the effect of time over things

1012
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:13,779
from your perspective thank you you know

1013
00:59:10,809 --> 00:59:18,489
I'm sorry about not fully understanding

1014
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:27,040
the question should I repeat it very

1015
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:29,699
briefly yeah I I mean my attitude to to

1016
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:33,519
Plato has been greatly influenced by

1017
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:37,230
Karl Popper although perhaps he has been

1018
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:40,150
a little too harsh on tato

1019
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:41,860
I think he's asking about progress

1020
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,910
whether you believe in progress progress

1021
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,579
I think so

1022
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:47,549
what what do you think yes I certainly

1023
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:52,569
have do believe in progress and

1024
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:55,750
definitely think that that we can

1025
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:58,860
improve our understanding and certainly

1026
00:59:55,750 --> 01:00:04,599
I would argue that let's say

1027
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:09,760
understanding reflexivity makes dealing

1028
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:14,519
with human problems political problems

1029
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:17,500
much more difficult and some of our

1030
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:22,269
preconceived ideas have to go out of the

1031
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:24,929
window but it is progress because I

1032
01:00:22,269 --> 01:00:30,539
think we then understand the

1033
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:37,629
difficulties involved in human affairs

1034
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:42,550
and you usually misconceptions get

1035
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:45,309
particularly wide and far-fetched when

1036
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:49,090
you are confronted with insoluble

1037
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:52,900
problems we don't like to tolerate

1038
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:58,630
insoluble problems and therefore we tend

1039
01:00:52,900 --> 01:01:03,610
to design device force solutions again I

1040
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:06,079
come back to the death which is an

1041
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:11,000
insoluble problem in the

1042
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:15,619
it's most likely to occur and we have

1043
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:21,349
then developed all kinds of ways of and

1044
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:26,660
myths to to do away with that prospect

1045
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:29,210
and there are many other to grow from

1046
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:32,089
the soup sublime to the ridiculous

1047
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:34,608
the drop problem

1048
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:37,670
it's an insoluble problem the drug

1049
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:42,190
addiction is in the in is innate in in

1050
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:46,430
in human nature some people get addicted

1051
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:51,019
and it is a threat to society and

1052
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:54,230
society then do usually did and the way

1053
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:59,630
did we deals it it makes it a much worse

1054
01:01:54,230 --> 01:02:02,929
problem and then then then the drug

1055
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:07,099
addiction itself and and the way for

1056
01:02:02,929 --> 01:02:12,199
instance American society has dealt it

1057
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:14,358
with death has made dying much harder

1058
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:18,049
and much more painful not to mention

1059
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:21,500
more expensive then then then it need to

1060
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:26,869
be and actually the two first projects

1061
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:29,030
of my foundation in in in America one

1062
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:31,630
was the project on death in America and

1063
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:35,810
the other one was the drug policy

1064
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:40,910
initiative and I arrived at it from this

1065
01:02:35,809 --> 01:02:44,420
rather abstract philosophical argument

1066
01:02:40,909 --> 01:02:46,759
about insoluble problems in Toledo da

1067
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:49,309
ting remedies which make the problems

1068
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,650
worse does that answer anywhere near

1069
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:56,150
your question

1070
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:58,610
enlighten me in other issues but yeah

1071
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:01,369
basically I wanted to ask you what do

1072
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:05,059
you think time the time time goes by

1073
01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:07,549
right and time has any kind of effect

1074
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:10,190
over things over a political regime

1075
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:12,950
Plato would say that time has a negative

1076
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:17,170
effect and the effect of time over

1077
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:20,119
things a turn turn it the generative as

1078
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:22,970
opposed to that conception modernity

1079
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:25,849
says that the effect of time over things

1080
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:28,250
is positive and says the future will be

1081
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:31,549
better now as against to the conception

1082
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:35,150
of Plato do what do you think what's the

1083
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:36,950
effect of that is if any at all or okay

1084
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:38,930
it's maybe a bit like me I have to

1085
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:40,609
interpret with which goes to wind up at

1086
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:43,989
this point I'm told that it's the end of

1087
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:43,990
the time and if you should do it

1088
01:03:54,329 --> 01:04:00,690
I know today's wonderful two hours has

1089
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:03,210
only whetted your appetite for the

1090
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:06,360
remainder of the week this has been an

1091
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:09,720
extraordinary moment and I want to thank

1092
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:11,700

1093

Soros for sharing his thoughts his

1098
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,389
experience his philosophy and launching

1099
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,529
us on an extraordinary journey that will

1100
