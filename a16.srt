university

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,480
in his lecture today mr soros will build

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
on the concept of open society that he

14
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:57,279
outlined yesterday

15
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,078
and he will explore the conflict between

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,000
capitalism and open society and between

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,719
market values

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
and

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,439
social values he will continue his

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,320
challenge to market fundamentalism while

21
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,919

universities on several continents

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,080
creating an unprecedented

26
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,438
global

27
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,200
real-time audience of students

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,320
from fudan university in shanghai whom

30

our moderator today is mark danner an

34
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,079
award-winning

foreign affairs politics and human

37
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
rights

38
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,640
as he has in previous lectures mr soros

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,520
will speak for approximately 50 minutes

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,319
following which mr danner will offer his

41
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,158
own brief commentary mr soros will then

42
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,239
take questions starting with three

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
questions from shanghai from the

44
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,280
students at fudon university

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,080
and then further questions from all of

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,318
you here in budapest

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,959
now to deliver his fourth lecture i'm

48
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,280
delighted once again to introduce george

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,759
soros whose extraordinary performance

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,719
over the last three days provides the

51
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:26,159
best possible introduction to what he

52
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,159
will tell us this afternoon

53
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,280
thank you

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,000
today

55
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,439
i want to explore the conflict between

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,519
capitalism

57
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,280
and open society

58
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,759
market values

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,239
and social values

60
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,759
but i'm going to approach the subject

61
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,840
indirectly

62
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,318
and by first introducing

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,959
introducing a phenomenon

64
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:06,799
that has attracted my attention only

65
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,239
recently but has assumed such importance

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,519
in my thinking

67
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,560
that i am

68
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,158
almost inclined to call it the fourth

69
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,640
pillar of my conceptual framework

70
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:22,399
that phenomenon is the principal agent

71
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,919
problem

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,480
agents

73
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,318
are supposed to represent the interests

74
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,000
of their principles

75
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,399
but in fact

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,519
they tend to put their own interests

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,920
ahead of the interests of those whom

78
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,239
they are supposed to represent that's

79
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,119
the agency problem

80
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,640
it's been extensively analyzed by

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,519
economists

82
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,079
but they look at it exclusively in terms

83
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,120
of contracts and incentives

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,560
and they largely disregard questions of

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,519
ethics and values

86
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,039
yet

87
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,239
if you leave

88
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:05,199
the ethical consideration out

89
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,120
the problem becomes pretty well

90
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,798
intractable

91
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
values like honesty and integrity lose

92
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,040
their grip

93
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:18,000
on people's behavior and people become

94
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,839
increasingly motivated by economic

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,879
incentives

96
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,879
by claiming to be value free

97
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:30,000
market fundamentalism

98
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,000
has actually undermined moral values

99
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,478
markets

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,160
are supposed to be guided by an

101
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,199
invisible hand

102
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,320
that's what makes them so efficient

103
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,199
participants need to exercise no moral

104
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:48,159
judgments in reaching their buy and sell

105
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,280
decisions because their actions are not

106
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,000
supposed to have any visible effect on

107
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,519
the market prices

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
in truth

109
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,918
the rules

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,400
governing mark financial markets are

111
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,159
decided by the visible hand of

112
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,359
politicians

113
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:12,320
and in a representative democracy

114
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,439
politicians run into an agency problem

115
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,079
thus

116
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,439
the agency problem poses grave

117
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:23,120
difficulties both for representative

118
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:26,560
democracy and the market economy which

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,639
can't be resolved without an appeal to

120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,360
moral principles

121
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,360
that's how the agency problem has gained

122
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,639
such prominence in my thinking

123
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,280
first i'll analyze the agency problem

124
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,759
and then i will deal with the conflict

125
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:48,959
between capitalism and open society

126
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,000
let me start at the beginning

127
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,839
i first encountered the agency problem

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,918
in connection with the so-called

129
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,519
resource curse

130
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:02,879
by resource curse i mean that countries

131
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:06,799
that are rich in natural resources are

132
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:10,000
often curves accursed by corrupt or

133
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,439
repressive governments insurrections

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,720
civil wars

135
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:18,000
so that the people are even poorer

136
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,360
and lead more miserable lives than in

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,478
countries that are less well endowed by

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
nature

139
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,758
think of the congo

140
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:30,318
sudan

141
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,319
sierra leone and liberia

142
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,960
one of the non-governmental

143
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,879
organizations i support global witness

144
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,560
proposed the campaign

145
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:45,918
based on the slogan publish what you pay

146
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,478
the idea was to get oil companies and

147
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,240
mining companies to disclose the

148
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,680
payments they make to various

149
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
governments

150
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,800
the amounts could then be added up

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,079
and the governments could be held

152
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,120
responsible by the people for for the

153
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,800
monies they received

154
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,800
the campaign was launched in 2002

155
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,720
and it has had an interesting history

156
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,478
the idea itself

157
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,440
turned out to be a

158
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:20,318
fertile fallacy because

159
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,360
while public opinion could could put

160
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,000
enough pressure on the big oil companies

161
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,160
fly-by-night operators

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,879
and companies domiciled in

163
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,400
non-democratic states were less

164
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,399
susceptible

165
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:39,198
so the amounts could not be added up

166
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,719
fortunately the british government took

167
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,919
up the course and formed the extractive

168
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,400
industries transparency initiative

169
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:52,318
which brought together governments

170
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:55,519
companies and civil society in an

171
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,240
in an effort to establish international

172
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,359
standards of transparency

173
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,598
which apply both to companies and to

174
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,160
governments

175
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:09,279
in those countries that subscribe to the

176
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,919
transparency initiative the governments

177
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,758
undertook to publish the amounts they

178
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,240
received

179
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,720
that is actually working

180
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,199
in countries like nigeria

181
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,199
and azerbaijan

182
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:30,000
in analyzing the resource curse

183
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,278
i came to attribute great importance to

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,120
what i called an asymmetric agency

185
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,519
problem

186
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,959
according to the modern concept of

187
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,440
sovereignty

188
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,879
the natural resources of a country

189
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,680
belong to the people of that country

190
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,360
but governments which are supposed to be

191
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,599
agents of the people

192
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
put their own interests ahead of the

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
interests of the people whom they are

194
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,399
supposed to represent

195
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,160
and engage in all sorts of corrupt

196
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,000
practices

197
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,879
on the opposite side

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,639
the managements of the international oil

199
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,559
and mining companies

200
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,958
represent the interests of of the

201
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,838
companies all too well

202
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:16,479
they used to go so far as to bribe

203
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,320
governments in order to obtain

204
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,440
concessions

205
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,519
willing takers and givers of tribes

206
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,320
are the root cause

207
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,320
root cause of the resource curse

208
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,119
once i became aware

209
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,640
of the agency problem

210
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,799
i discovered it everywhere

211
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,519
communism failed

212
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,759
because of the agency problem

213
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,759
karl marx's proposition

214
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,399
from everybody according to their

215
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,600
ability and to everybody according to

216
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,159
their needs

217
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,639
was a very attractive idea

218
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,958
but the communist rulers put their own

219
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,278
interests ahead of the interests of the

220
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,879
people

221
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:05,600
the agency problem is also the bane of

222
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,600
representative democracy

223
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
because the elected representatives

224
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,278
use their powers

225
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,839
for their own interests to the detriment

226
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,799
of the common

227
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,519
interest and

228
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,679
in the recent financial crisis

229
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,879
the agency problem proved to be the

230
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,359
undoing of the financial system

231
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,399
when financial engineers

232
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,360
turned mortgages into securities

233
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,679
by issuing collateralized debt

234
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
obligations or cdos

235
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,838
they thought

236
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,759
they were reducing risks

237
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,519
through geographical

238
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,958
diversification

239
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,519
in reality

240
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,919
they were introducing a new risk

241
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,759
by separating the interests of the

242
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:58,240
agents who who created and distributed

243
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,720
the synthetic instruments from the

244
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,079
interests of the owners of those

245
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,240
securities

246
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,759
and the agents were more interested in

247
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,120
earning fees

248
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,439
than in protecting the interests of the

249
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,240
principles

250
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:19,200
so the agency problem seemed ubiquitous

251
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,159
yet in spite of its pervasive influence

252
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,600
it escaped attention until recently

253
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,120
in my student days it was almost totally

254
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,278
unrecognized

255
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,679
in the last 20 years

256
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,639
it has received more attention

257
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:38,239
but mainly from economists who studied

258
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,679
it in terms of contracts and incentives

259
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,639
in reality

260
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,759
the agency problem is more of an ethical

261
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,799
problem

262
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:50,240
and analyzing it in terms of contracts

263
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,399
and incentives actually aggravated the

264
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,879
ethical problem

265
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,200
establishing the principle

266
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,480
that principle that people's behavior is

267
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,680
governed by contracts and incentives had

268
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,278
the effect of eliminating or at least

269
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:10,599
diminishing ethical considerations

270
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:15,958
that may sound perverse but only because

271
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,959
reflexivity is not well understood

272
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,839
values

273
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,600
are less

274
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,000
closely governed by an objective reality

275
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,639
than cognitive notions

276
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,559
therefore they are more easily

277
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:44,639
shaped by the theories that people adopt

278
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,799
and economic theory is a case in point

279
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,079
markets are supposed to act as an

280
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,559
invisible hand bringing the demand and

281
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,799
supply into balance

282
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,078
what makes the invisible hand so

283
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,958
efficient

284
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,519
is that there is no need to exercise

285
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:05,199
moral judgment all values can be

286
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:08,720
expressed in terms of money and money is

287
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,560
fungible pecunia knowledge

288
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,600
money doesn't smell

289
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:17,359
the romans used to say

290
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,800
but taking it for granted that all human

291
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,680
behavior is guided by self-interest

292
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,958
leaves no room for the exercise of moral

293
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,679
judgment

294
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:31,919
and society can't exist

295
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,919
without some ethical precepts

296
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:37,759
the behavior of market participants is

297
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,959
guided by market values

298
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,078
and market values are quite different in

299
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,119
character

300
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:48,799
from the moral values that are supposed

301
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,759
to guide the behavior of people as

302
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:55,759
members of society

303
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:58,639
this opens up a whole range of questions

304
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:01,679
which i have not been able to resolve

305
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,519
concerning the conflict between market

306
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,479
values and social values

307
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,278
the

308
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,720
agency problem has provided me with some

309
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,838
new insights

310
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,278
i was also inspired by a short monograph

311
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,880
by bruce r scott on the concept of

312
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,759
capitalism

313
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,958
as a result i may have something new to

314
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,399
say

315
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,518
indeed

316
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:31,839
i myself am shocked by some of the

317
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,839
conclusions i have reached

318
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,079
scott argues

319
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,639
that capitalism has been misinterpreted

320
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,159
by conflating it with the market

321
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,320
mechanism

322
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:47,360
this is a distortion that scott

323
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,240
attributes mainly to milton friedman

324
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,039
i'm less specific and attributed to

325
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,959
market fundamentalism

326
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,078
scott argues

327
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,439
further

328
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:02,958
that behind the invisible hand of the

329
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,639
market lurks the visible hand of human

330
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:10,399
agency namely the political process

331
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,879
which sets and administers the rules

332
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,799
this is where the agency problem comes

333
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,278
into play

334
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,399
so does the conflict between market

335
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,078
values

336
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,078
and social values

337
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,480
the united states is a democratic open

338
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,360
society based on the freedom of the

339
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,079
individual protected by the rule of law

340
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,600
as defined by the constitution

341
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:40,000
at the same time the american economy is

342
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,720
based on the market mechanism which

343
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,679
allows individuals to engage in free

344
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,800
exchange without undue

345
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,559
interference from arbitrary actions by

346
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,078
governmental

347
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,439
authority

348
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,638
the political

349
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,959
and economic arrangements seem to fit

350
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,360
together seamlessly

351
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:04,479
one could easily speak of an open

352
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,600
society and a market economy in the same

353
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,360
breath

354
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,159
and people including me often do

355
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,440
but appearances are deceptive

356
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:18,559
there is a deep-seated conflict between

357
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,440
capitalism and open society market

358
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:24,239
values and social values

359
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,959
the conf the conflict has been

360
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,600
successfully covered up by the market

361
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:33,599
fundamentalist ideology

362
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,839
which gained the upper hand in the 1980s

363
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,839
during ronald reagan's presidency

364
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,278
the distinguishing feature of the market

365
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:48,159
mechanism is that it is a moral

366
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:52,320
one person's dollar is worth exactly the

367
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:55,759
same as another person's irrespective of

368
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,800
how he how she came to possess it

369
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,360
that's what makes markets so efficient

370
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,198
participants needn't worry about moral

371
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,038
considerations

372
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:09,678
in an efficient market an individual

373
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:13,038
individual decisions affect market

374
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,919
prices only marginally if one person

375
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,480
abstained from participating as either

376
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,799
buyer or seller someone else would take

377
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,360
her place with only a marginal

378
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,400
difference in the price

379
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,719
therefore

380
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,559
individual market participants bear

381
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,519
little responsibility for the outcome

382
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,960
but

383
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,079
markets are suitable only for individual

384
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,880
choices

385
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,240
not for social decisions

386
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,280
they allow individual participants to

387
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,279
engage in free exchange but they are not

388
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:52,160
designed to exercise social choices such

389
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:56,079
as deciding the rules that should govern

390
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,279
society including how market how the

391
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:02,480
market mechanism should function

392
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:06,079
that's the preview of politics

393
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,160
extending the idea of a freestanding

394
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,918
market

395
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,919
self-governing and self-correcting to

396
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,360
the political sphere

397
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:18,720
is highly deceptive because it removes

398
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:21,199
ethical considerations from politics

399
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,440
which can't properly function without

400
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
them

401
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,519
in the united states

402
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,399
politics takes the form of

403
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:33,918
representative democracy

404
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,759
people elect representatives who operate

405
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,080
believers of power

406
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,960
they are agents who are supposed to

407
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,480
represent the interests of the people

408
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,720
in reality

409
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,200
they tend to put their own interests

410
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,798
ahead of the interests of the people

411
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
getting elected

412
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,440
is expensive

413
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,120
and representatives are beholden to

414
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,880
their supporters

415
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,879
those who don't play

416
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
who don't play the game

417
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,080
don't get elected

418
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,400
that's how money pollutes politics and

419
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:10,480
special interests

420
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,720
trump the public interest

421
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,679
the agency problem in the american

422
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,360
political system is not new it's

423
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,400
inherent in a representative democracy

424
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,959
the right to petition elected

425
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,038
representatives was written into the

426
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,840
constitution

427
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,240
yet

428
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,839
the agency problem seems to be much more

429
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,720
severe today

430
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:39,119
than it was even as recently as my

431
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,360
arrival in the united states in 1956

432
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,359
why

433
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,400
there are several

434
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,760
objective historical developments

435
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,759
which may be held partly responsibly

436
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,359
partly responsible

437
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:01,038
notably the development of sophisticated

438
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:04,399
methods of manipulating public opinion

439
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:08,240
and the growth of special interests

440
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,038
but the main culprit is a decline in

441
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,919
public morality

442
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,879
fostered by the rise of market

443
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,200
fundamentalism

444
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,919
i'd like to think that at the time of

445
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,038
the founding of the republic citizens

446
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,640
were genuinely guided by a sense of

447
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,679
civic virtue

448
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,320
fortunately the founding fathers didn't

449
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,519
put much faith in that and built the

450
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:38,399
constitution on the division of powers

451
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,158
they created checks and balances between

452
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,440
competing interests

453
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,200
that's why the constitution

454
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,200
holds up so well

455
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:53,120
in spite of the decline in morality

456
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,679
even when i first arrived in 1956

457
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,199
people professed to be guided by

458
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,798
intrinsic values like honesty and intel

459
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,759
integrity

460
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:06,319
it may have been

461
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,319
hypocritical with all kinds of vices

462
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:11,038
clandestinely practiced

463
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,038
but still it was very different from

464
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,960
today's public life

465
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,158
where the blatant pursuit of

466
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,279
self-interest is openly admitted and

467
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:25,440
people are admired for being successful

468
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:29,200
irrespective of how they achieved it

469
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,200
i don't want to be misunderstood

470
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:36,480
painting too rosy a picture of the past

471
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,359
is characteristic of people of a certain

472
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,000
age

473
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,839
and i i don't want to fall into such an

474
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,279
obvious trap

475
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,480
i don't claim

476
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:50,240
that politicians were more honest and

477
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,480
society more just in 1956

478
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,240
america has made great progress since

479
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,519
then in transparency accountability and

480
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,960
social equality but there has been

481
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:07,599
a remarkable transformation in what i

482
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:10,840
believe uh in in is the behavior of uh

483
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,639
of what is socially acceptable and even

484
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,240
admirable

485
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,080
due to the rise of market fundamentalism

486
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,519
i describe it

487
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:25,038
as a decline in public morality in a

488
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:27,200
very special sense by contrasting it

489
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:30,558
with the immorality

490
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,558
of market values

491
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,799
i define market fundamentalism as the

492
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,519
undue extension of market values to

493
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,359
other spheres of social life notably

494
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,918
politics

495
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:48,719
economic theory claims that in

496
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,600
conditions of general equilibrium the

497
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,759
invisible hand assures the optimum

498
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,959
allocation of resources

499
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,240
this means

500
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,000
that people pursuing their self-interest

501
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,720
are indirectly

502
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,599
also serving the public interest

503
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,880
it gives self-interest and the profit

504
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:11,119
motive

505
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:15,360
moral imprimatur which allows them to

506
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:18,399
replace virtues like honesty integrity

507
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:21,359
and concern for others

508
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,640
the argument is invalid on several

509
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,839
counts

510
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,159
first

511
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,759
financial markets don't tend towards

512
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,520
equilibrium

513
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,038
general equilibrium

514
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,119
theory reached this its conclusion by

515
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,240
taking the conditions of supply and

516
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:41,599
demand as independently given

517
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,679
the invisible hand of the market then

518
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,959
brings supply and demand into

519
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,360
equilibrium

520
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,798
this approach ignores

521
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,399
the reflexive feedback loops between

522
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,599
market prices

523
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,519
prices and the underlying conditions of

524
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,879
supply and demand

525
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,879
it also ignores the visible hand of the

526
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,799
political process

527
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,000
which lies hidden

528
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,759
behind the market mechanism

529
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,558
second

530
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:16,558
the general equilibrium theory takes the

531
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:19,440
initial allocation of resources as given

532
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,200
this rules out any consideration of

533
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,960
social justice

534
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,720
most importantly

535
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,880
the theory assumes that people know

536
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,759
what their self-interest is

537
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,278
and how best to pursue it

538
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,400
in reality

539
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,839
there is a significant gap between what

540
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,080
people think

541
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,359
and what the facts are

542
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,079
nevertheless

543
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,599
market fundamentalism has emerged

544
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,639
triumphant

545
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,639
how could that happen

546
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,159
one reason is

547
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
that the main

548
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,600
policy implication of market

549
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,919
fundamentalism

550
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,798
that government interference in the

551
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,880
economy should be kept to a minimum

552
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:07,359
is not as unsound

553
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:10,559
as the arguments employed to justify it

554
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:13,599
the market mechanism may be flawed

555
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,038
by but the political process is even

556
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,759
more so

557
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,240
participants in the political process

558
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,759
are even more fallible than market

559
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,798
participants

560
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,679
because

561
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,599
politics revolve around social values

562
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,720
whereas markets

563
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,079
take the the participants values as

564
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,519
given

565
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,480
as we have seen

566
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,158
social values are highly susceptible to

567
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,519
manipulation

568
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,679
moreover

569
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,200
politics are poisoned by the agency

570
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,840
problem

571
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,319
to guard against the agency problem

572
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:51,759
all kinds of safeguards have to be

573
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:54,639
introduced and this makes the behavior

574
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:58,079
of governmental agencies in the economic

575
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,400
sphere much more rigid and bureaucratic

576
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,000
than the behavior of private

577
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,000
participants

578
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,558
on all these grounds

579
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,038
it makes sense to argue

580
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:13,119
that governmental interference in the

581
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:14,000
economy should be kept to a minimum

582
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,639
so

583
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
market fundamentalism has merely

584
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,960
substituted an invalid argument for what

585
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,480
could have been a much stronger one

586
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,600
it could have argued

587
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,400
that all human constructs are imperfect

588
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:33,439
and social choices involve choosing the

589
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,840
lesser level and on those grounds

590
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,919
government intervention in the economy

591
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,240
should be kept to a minimum that would

592
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,200
have been a reasonable position

593
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,159
instead it claimed that the failures of

594
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,880
government intervention proved that the

595
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,600
free markets are perfect and that's

596
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,000
simply bad logic

597
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:57,278
i want to make myself quite clear

598
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,480
i condemn market fundamentalism as a

599
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:03,200
false and dangerous doctrine but i'm in

600
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,640
favor of keeping government intervention

601
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,679
and regulations to a minimum for other

602
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,679
and better reasons

603
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,400
by far the most powerful force

604
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,919
working in favor of market

605
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,360
fundamentalism

606
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:25,120
is that it serves the self-interest of

607
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:27,839
the owners and managers of capital

608
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:31,119
the distribution of wealth is taken as

609
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:34,000
given and the pursuit of self-interest

610
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:37,038
is found to serve the common interest

611
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,839
what more could those who are in control

612
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,359
of capital ask for

613
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,918
they constitute

614
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,319
a wealthy and powerful group

615
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,679
well positioned to promote market

616
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,879
fundamentalism not only by cognitive

617
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,080
argument

618
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,000
but by the active manipulation of public

619
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,960
opinion

620
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,839
market fundamentalism endows them at the

621
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,519
market mechanism which is immoral by

622
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:08,000
nature with a moral character and turns

623
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,720
the pursuit of self-interest into a

624
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,919
civic virtue similar to the pursuit of

625
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,759
truth

626
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,200
it has prevailed by the force of

627
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,839
manipulation

628
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,399
not by the force of reason it's

629
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:23,278
supported by a powerful and

630
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:26,398
well-financed propaganda machine which

631
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:29,200
distorts the public's understanding

632
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,479
of its own self-interest

633
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,360
for example

634
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,399
how could the how else

635
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:39,439
could the campaign to repeal the estate

636
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,839
tax which applies only to an elite one

637
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,840
percent of the population have been so

638
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,839
successful

639
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,559
there are of course

640
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:04,080
competing forces in the political arena

641
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:07,119
that use similar methods of manipulation

642
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,199
but they tend to be less well financed

643
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,158
because they can't draw on the

644
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,640
self-interest of the wealthiest and most

645
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,480
powerful segment of the population

646
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,679
that's how

647
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,278
market fundamentalism has emerged

648
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:26,720
triumphant in the last 25 years

649
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:30,159
and even the financial crisis was not

650
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,720
sufficient to impair its influence

651
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,399
this was demonstrated by president

652
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,440
obama's decision

653
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:40,000
to avoid recapitalizing the banks in a

654
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,200
way that would have given the government

655
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,200
majority control

656
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,360
market fundamentalism should not be

657
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,558
conflated with the efficient market

658
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,479
hypothesis you can be an economist

659
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,918
working on that hypothesis

660
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,640
or with that hypothesis without being a

661
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,600
market fundamentalist indeed many

662
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,960
economies are bleeding hard liberals

663
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,359
but the efficient market hypothesis has

664
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,558
a stranglehold on the teaching of

665
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:15,519
economics in american universities and

666
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:18,879
that phenomenon can be attributed to the

667
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,319
financial support given by capitalists

668
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,120
and foundations committed to market

669
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,599
fundamentalism

670
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:29,038
they are also responsible for the

671
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:31,278
encroachment of market values into other

672
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:35,158
disciplines like law

673
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,159
and political science

674
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:41,038
capitalism is not directly opposed to

675
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,080
open society

676
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,440
the way

677
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:48,398
soviet communism was nevertheless it

678
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,038
poses some serious threats

679
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:53,839
i've also i have already discussed one

680
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:58,000
of them the financial markets are not

681
00:30:53,839 --> 00:31:00,240
equilibrium bound but bubble prone

682
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,919
the dismantling of the regular

683
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,640
regulatory mechanism has given rise to a

684
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,480
super bubble whose bursting will

685
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,399
negatively influence the american

686
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,440
economy for several years to come

687
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:18,398
this discussion has revealed another

688
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,880
threat you know to open society the

689
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:24,079
agency problem and the influence of

690
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,039
money in politics which contaminate the

691
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:30,158
political process

692
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:33,278
in an open society the political process

693
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,320
is supposed to serve the common interest

694
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:38,880
in contemporary america the political

695
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,158
process has been captured by special

696
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,278
interests

697
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,559
our elected representatives are beholden

698
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,720
to those who finance their election not

699
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,440
to the electorate at large

700
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,798
what's happening to president obama's

701
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,360
health care and energy bills provides a

702
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:00,000
vivid illustration

703
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,719
the electorate has been brainwashed to

704
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,200
such an extent that a responsible

705
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,558
discussion of the public good

706
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,159
has become well nigh impossible

707
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:15,678
a national health service and the carbon

708
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:19,278
tax are non-starters

709
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,278
our choices are confined to solutions

710
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,919
that can be gained

711
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,000
by a special interest such as cap and

712
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,200
trade

713
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,720
lobbying

714
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,480
is at the core of the agency problem

715
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,558
how can it be brought under control

716
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,120
this is an ethical issue

717
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,720
and not a matter of modifying economic

718
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,000
incentives

719
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,278
because

720
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
lobbying is lucrative and it's liable to

721
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,440
remain so even if the rules are

722
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,759
tightened

723
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,278
in the absence of moral values

724
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:57,519
regulations can always be circumvented

725
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:00,558
and what's worse the regulations

726
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,159
themselves will be designed to serve

727
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:04,079
special interests

728
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,159
not the common interest

729
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,678
this is the danger facing the united

730
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,399
states today

731
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,360
when a wounded financial sector

732
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:16,798
is his work is seeking to regain its

733
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,798
former preeminence

734
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,599
there is a way

735
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,960
to deal with the ethical issue

736
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:29,519
we need to draw a clear distinction

737
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,120
between the economic and political

738
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,319
spheres

739
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:37,119
market participation and rule making

740
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:41,119
are two different functions

741
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:44,879
markets allow participants to engage in

742
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,518
free exchange here it's quite legitimate

743
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,278
for the participants to be guided by the

744
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,960
profit motive

745
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:54,000
by contrast

746
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,640
the making and enforcement of rules

747
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,319
ought to be guided by consideration of

748
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,919
the public good

749
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:04,639
here the profit motive is misplaced

750
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,559
it's when people try to bend the rules

751
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,559
to their own advantage

752
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,838
that the political process becomes

753
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,440
corrupted

754
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:16,239
and representative democracy fails to

755
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,119
produce the results that would make open

756
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,598
society a desirable form of social

757
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,519
organization

758
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,800
it should be emphasized

759
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:29,280
that this argument directly contradicts

760
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,560
the currently fashionable market

761
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,000
fundamentalist attitude which speaks of

762
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,759
a political marketplace

763
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,119
how could

764
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,359
the political process be improved in an

765
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,320
open society

766
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:49,598
i propose a rather simple rule

767
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,639
people should separate their role as

768
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,879
market participants from their role as

769
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,519
political participants

770
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,960
as market participants they ought to

771
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,559
pursue their

772
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,519
their self-interest

773
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:06,000
as participants in the political process

774
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,759
they ought to be guided by the public

775
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,800
interest

776
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,839
the justification for this rule

777
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,560
is also rather simple

778
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,920
if in conditions close to perfect

779
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,519
competition

780
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,039
no single competitor can affect the

781
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,159
market prices

782
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,679
therefore

783
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:30,879
individual market decisions have no

784
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,679
effect on social conditions whether or

785
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,320
not

786
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,879
one cares about the common good

787
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,480
but political decisions

788
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,519
do affect social conditions therefore it

789
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,679
makes all the difference whether or not

790
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,679
they serve the public interest

791
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,640
the trouble is

792
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,440
that

793
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,000
the public good can't be determined by

794
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,440
reference to a generally accepted

795
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,760
objective standard it's contingent on

796
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,480
the views of the electorate

797
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,839
but

798
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,199
in the absence of an objective standard

799
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:12,799
these views are easily manipulated

800
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:15,759
and manipulation is self-reinforcing

801
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,640
the more outrageous the political claims

802
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,160
and counter-claims the harder it is to

803
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:24,000
tell what is right and what is wrong

804
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:27,039
that's what has made the political

805
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,920
process so ineffective in the united

806
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,960
states today

807
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,039
by contrast the market mechanism

808
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,079
functions much better

809
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:41,039
people may not know what's good for them

810
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,920
but profits do provide an objective

811
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,559
criterion by which market participants

812
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,838
performance can be measured

813
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,719
no wonder

814
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:54,159
that the profit motive has gained such

815
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:56,159
prominence among the values that guide

816
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:59,358
people's behavior

817
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:02,000
not only do prophets provide the means

818
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:04,880
for the pursuit of whatever ends people

819
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,320
may have but they also serve as an end

820
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,400
in itself

821
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:13,119
because as a reliable measure of success

822
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,160
they attract other people's admiration

823
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,280
and generate self-esteem

824
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,078
indeed

825
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,800
many successful business people feel

826
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,640
much more secure in making money

827
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,640
than in using their wealth

828
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,519
the spread

829
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,960
of market values has brought immense

830
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:39,119
economic benefits

831
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,880
in the course of history

832
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,358
looking back

833
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,160
christianity

834
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,279
used to treat the pursuit of profit as

835
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,480
sinful

836
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,760
this hampered economic development

837
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,400
the reformation then facilitated the

838
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,040
development of markets and opened the

839
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,599
way to material progress and the

840
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:05,838
accumulation of wealth

841
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:08,880
society underwent a great transformation

842
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:11,440
traditional relationships were replaced

843
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,760
by contractual ones

844
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,559
contractual relations

845
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,720
came to penetrate into more and more

846
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:22,159
spheres of social life

847
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:25,039
and eventually relationships started to

848
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,519
be replaced by transactions

849
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,800
the pace of change continued to

850
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,239
accelerate

851
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,720
it sped up spread up tremendously during

852
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,159
my lifetime

853
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,879
the difference

854
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:41,519
between my childhood in hungary

855
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,960
and my adult life in america is quite

856
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,679
dramatic

857
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:50,079
so were the changes that occurred in

858
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:51,598
america between my arrival in 1956 and

859
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,240
the present day

860
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,599
when i first came to america

861
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:00,399
i was struck by how much further market

862
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,880
values had penetrated into society

863
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,240
than in my native hungary or even

864
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,599
england where traditional values and

865
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,959
class distinctions still prevailed

866
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,400
since then

867
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,800
both england and america underwent a

868
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,760
further transformation

869
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,760
the professions like medicine and law

870
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,040
became businesses

871
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,760
in my view

872
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,039
this has had a destabilizing effect on

873
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,280
society

874
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:33,039
just as market fundamentalism has had a

875
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,800
destabilizing effect on financial

876
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,599
markets

877
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,240
now

878
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,200
exactly what level of stability is

879
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,559
socially desirable is of course a matter

880
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,279
of opinion

881
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:48,320
what is the proper role of the profit

882
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,760
motive in the professions such as law

883
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,119
and medicine

884
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,079
and the media

885
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,480
is similarly open to debate

886
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,720
but there can be no question

887
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,358
that the profit motive has had a

888
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:04,318
nefarious influence in the political

889
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:07,279
sphere because it has aggravated the

890
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,279
agency problem

891
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:15,759
how can the agency problem be minimized

892
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:18,639
it's too much to expect

893
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,359
uh those value those who have a vital

894
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:23,039
and special interest at stake not to

895
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,000
lobby congress

896
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,480
the tobacco industry is bound to oppose

897
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,039
legislation against cigarettes

898
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,358
and the insurance industry

899
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,199
will be against a single-payer

900
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:38,078
healthcare system

901
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,960
but those who don't have a vital

902
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,839
interest at stake ought to give pressure

903
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,159
precedence to the public interest over

904
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,078
their narrow self-interest

905
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:51,440
they needn't be bothered by the

906
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:54,079
so-called free rider problem namely that

907
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,880
others who act more selfishly would also

908
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,560
benefit from their unselfish behavior

909
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,920
because the objective of the exercise is

910
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,920
to benefit the public

911
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,640
to sum up

912
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,159
yesterday

913
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,078
i argued

914
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,799
that the cognitive

915
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,560
function ought to be given precedence

916
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,480
over the manipulative function today

917
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:25,199
i argue that while the prophet motive is

918
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,240
perfectly justified within the existing

919
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:30,399
rules when it comes to making the rules

920
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:33,759
the public interests ought to be given

921
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,760
precedence over personal interests

922
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,839
i firmly believe

923
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,040
that if

924
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,559
a minority of the electorate met those

925
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:46,838
two requirements

926
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:49,358
representative democracy would function

927
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:51,679
better now

928
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,318
i realize that this is

929
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,679
perhaps a politically

930
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:57,599
incorrect

931
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,559
elitist

932
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,280
point of view because i attribute

933
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:05,039
great importance to to

934
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,400
an elite

935
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,279
that is devoted to the pursuit of truth

936
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,960
and

937
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,720
uh devoted to the public in in interest

938
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,039
but uh

939
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,679
i i firmly believe

940
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,880
that that is what we need

941
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,919
uh for

942
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,119
an open society uh to

943
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,880
uh

944
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,800
to flourish

945
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,960
uh uh

946
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:37,119
and and and actually even to survive

947
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,639
now i'd like to end on a personal mode

948
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,599
uh i have practiced what i preach

949
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:45,519
as a fan as a hedge fund manager i have

950
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,559
played by the rules

951
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:50,000
and try to maximize my profits

952
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,039
as a citizen

953
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,480
i try to improve the rules even if the

954
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:59,519
reforms go against my personal interests

955
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,079
for instance i support the regulation of

956
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,679
hedge funds along with other financial

957
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,280
institutions

958
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,199
i firmly believe

959
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
that if more people followed this

960
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:11,199
precept

961
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,639
our political system would function much

962
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,239
better

963
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,199
i also believe

964
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,719
that foundations like mine can play an

965
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:19,919
important role

966
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:21,919
exactly

967
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,639
because so few people

968
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,599
follow that precept

969
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,559
in

970
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,318
the open society institute we have made

971
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,480
it our business

972
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,838
to protect the public interest against

973
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,199
the encroachments of private interests

974
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:42,480
we are also supporting civil society

975
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:45,759
in holding governments accountable

976
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,838
i would describe these endeavors as

977
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,800
political philanthropy

978
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:53,279
and i believe that it can make a greater

979
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,519
contribution to make the world a better

980
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,560
place than more conventional

981
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,358
philanthropy because fewer people are

982
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,078
engaged in it

983
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:06,799
i'm in a privileged position

984
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,680
i'm more independent than most people

985
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,880
because i don't depend on clients or

986
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,919
customers

987
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:18,160
and i feel under a moral obligation to

988
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,760
put my privileged position to good use

989
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,679
i'm of course

990
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,400
greatly outgunned

991
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,358
by

992
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,000
special interests but at least i have

993
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:31,358
the satisfaction that my money has

994
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,880
greater scarcity value

995
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:36,078
the trouble is

996
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,039
that special interests also seek to

997
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,480
disguise themselves as protectors of the

998
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,679
public interest

999
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:47,039
and it takes a discerning eye to

1000
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,078
discriminate between the genuine and the

1001
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,679
phony

1002
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:55,280
especially as both sides are for forced

1003
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:59,039
to resort to similar methods of

1004
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,560
persuasion and manipulation

1005
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,358
in the absence

1006
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,920
of objective criteria

1007
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:09,279
one can only reach a judgment by a

1008
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,559
process of trial and error

1009
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,839
people

1010
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:17,119
of good intentions engaged on one side

1011
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:19,358
of the debate often find it difficult to

1012
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,880
believe that there are people on the

1013
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:24,960
other side with equally good intentions

1014
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,240
the best way to find out

1015
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,960
is by taking their claims at face value

1016
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,639
and engaging them on the substance of

1017
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,358
their argument

1018
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,838
this has the beneficial effect

1019
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:41,039
of giving the cognitive function

1020
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:44,480
precedence in the political debate

1021
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,480
only if they fail to respond in kind

1022
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,199
should they be dismissed and

1023
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,800
subsequently ignored

1024
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,159
there are people like that in every

1025
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,599
country

1026
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,759
unfortunately

1027
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,680
in the united states they are not

1028
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,599
ignored they have become very

1029
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,000
influential

1030
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,880
whether the electorate

1031
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
also refuses to be influenced by

1032
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,960
people who try to manipulate them

1033
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,920
with total disregard for the truth is

1034
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,720
the test that every open society has to

1035
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,639
pass to remain open

1036
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:23,759
given the success of ovalian propaganda

1037
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:25,199
america is not doing very well in this

1038
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,200
regard

1039
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:30,000
the political process

1040
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:33,598
which has served america well for two

1041
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,639
centuries seems to have deteriorated

1042
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,000
we used to have two parties competing

1043
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:39,679
for the middle

1044
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,039
but the middle ground

1045
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,399
has shrunk

1046
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,000
and politics

1047
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:49,760
have become increasingly polarized

1048
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,639
president obama has done his level best

1049
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:56,480
to reverse the trend he has tried to be

1050
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:57,838
the great uniter but to no avail

1051
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,159
in the end

1052
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:03,358
how a democracy functions

1053
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:06,639
depends on the people who live in it

1054
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:09,519
i believe that if more people separated

1055
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:11,199
their role as political participants

1056
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:12,000
from their role

1057
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,199
as

1058
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,880
market participants american democracy

1059
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,239
would function

1060
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,160
much better it's up to each individual

1061
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,799
that's what i have done

1062
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:28,799
and even a small minority could be

1063
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,400
helpful in rebuilding the vanishing

1064
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,000
middle ground

1065
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:38,318
thank you

1066
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:40,400
[Applause]

1067
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:40,400
you
