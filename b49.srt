1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,360
there is a deep-seated

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:10,439
conflict between capitalism and the open

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,280
Society I want to start with that rather

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:17,399
striking quotation from George soros's

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,480
extremely rich and provocative talk to

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,439
let those words reverberate once again

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,439
through the

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:27,759
hall uh in their Clarity but also in

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:31,800
their radicalism we're standing here in

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,920
budapes almost precisely 20 years after

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,960
the fall of the Berlin

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,039
Wall uh and I remember vividly that time

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,960
20 years ago when the talk in the United

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,198
States was not only about the

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,558
inevitability of capitalism and

16
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:52,799
democracy because those two go obviously

17
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:55,280
hand inand but the Assumption and the

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,358
argument uh that the combination of

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,558
those two systems if you will political

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,920
and economic constituted the end of

21
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,478
History to use the title of the famous

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,079
essay by Francis fukiyama fukiyama was

23
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:13,719
arguing uh uh borrowing ideas from Kev

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,200
and Hegel uh that the fall of the wall

25
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:19,400
beckoned a new age in which capitalism

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,000
and democracy working hand in hand would

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,520
essentially take over the world well we

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,280
know that history didn't end uh we know

29
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,280
about the Balkans Rwanda the Gulf War

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,200
the Iraq wall War the there's been a

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,680
great deal of history since then but it

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:41,079
is striking uh to find in this place uh

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,640
uh expressed by a key figure in World

34
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,359
capitalism and World Finance the notion

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,040
that democracy and the open Society are

36
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:51,680
as they exist today and compatible I

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,600
want to uh seize on my rights as

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,079
moderator and reconceive this question a

39
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,158
little bit as a reporter as well in

40
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:02,559
terms of power power versus the open

41
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,960
Society I was reminded thinking as

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,280
George spoke uh of a time in 1987 when I

43
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,079
was covering the Haitian election which

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,039
was supposed to bring the transition of

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,160
democracy to Haiti after a long

46
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,919
dictatorship and turned out to be a

47
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,560
bloody disaster in which the people with

48
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,039
power confronted the challenge of all of

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,640
these people standing there ready to

50
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,759
vote by sending gunmen uh to murder them

51
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,119
murdering a couple of hundred of them as

52
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:32,079
it turned out I remember thinking at the

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,280
time that our vision of democracy is at

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,480
its heart a kind of beautiful myth it

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,120
proposes that on one sacred day everyone

56
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,479
in the society the powerless and the

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,759
powerful the poor and the wealthy stand

58
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,158
together with exactly the same amount of

59
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,560
power they have the power of one one

60
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:55,318
vote but of course that day does not

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,920
change power relations within a society

62
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:01,000
in Haiti the powerful pay gunmen

63
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,919
wielding ues and machetes to go and kill

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,039
voters in the United States the powerful

65
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,639
pay lobbyists to Lobby Congress pay

66
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,639
admen to make

67
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,199
advertisements uh pay political

68
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,399
candidates uh to run their campaigns um

69
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,919
trying to press down power in one place

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,799
is like pressing down on water in a lake

71
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,079
it rises somewhere else it seems to me

72
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,280
then that the heart of this problem has

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,159
to do with our conception of the open

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Society particularly as George has set

75
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,719
it out to you today and in the previous

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,878
lectures and I want to press him a

77
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,560
little bit on this issue because the

78
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:41,158
open Society we're talking about which

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,560
he said is supposed to or exists to

80
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,039
promote the public good in fact was not

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,360
set up that way uh the framers the

82
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,679
famous framers of the Constitution put

83
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,560
together a system whose major function

84
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,120
was to divide government Power Balance

85
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,438
it one part against the other and to try

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,079
to clear a private space in which

87
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:02,799
government power could not dominate a

88
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,400
good example is the famous First

89
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,438
Amendment we've heard today about

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,799
brainwashing about the manipulation of

91
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:10,878
the public the use of the press to do

92
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,159
that we all know how this has happened

93
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,560
and is happening in the United States

94
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:17,000
the fact is though when we look at the

95
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,600
famous First Amendment what do we find

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,399
we find no right to truth we find uh no

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,080
right to Enlightenment uh we find no

98
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,399
right to know although we hear that

99
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,879
phrase used often the full text of the

100
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:32,120
First Amendment as regards freedom of of

101
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,000
the press reads as follows Congress

102
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,560
shall make no law abridging the freedom

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,038
of the press that is it is a limitation

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,720
on government Vis A the press it says

105
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:44,360
nothing about private forces uh and

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,320
indeed the Press is a collection of

107
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,720
private institutions moneymaking

108
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,879
institutions that can indeed be

109
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,680
manipulated it also says nothing about

110
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:56,240
restraining private power from

111
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,280
influencing politics through elections

112
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,319
so I would say today and I'd like to ask

113
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,239
George about this

114
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,478
isn't our problem really doesn't our

115
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,079
problem really have to do with

116
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:11,478
renovating our open society as it exists

117
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:14,519
uh in ways that will conceive of it less

118
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:17,399
as a neutral arbitrator and more of an

119
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,439
active power trying to assure what

120
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,239
George called the common good now this

121
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,918
may sound like a radical proposal in

122
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,879
fact we've had a hundred years of

123
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:29,719
fighting over precisely this issue

124
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,719
within the United States uh one example

125
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,800
boring as it is is campaign Finance

126
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,759
reform George said it's very and TR

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,000
rightly said it's extremely expensive to

128
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,879
get elected elected officials uh feel

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,199
that they uh owe falty to those who paid

130
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,478
for their uh campaigns this is obviously

131
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,240
true but in fact there's nothing

132
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,279
inherently expensive about getting

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,000
elected 70% of the cost of running for

134
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:58,079
office is buying television time the

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,918
Airways belong to the public the

136
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,879
government could has absolutely the

137
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:05,439
right to require although it can't limit

138
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,959
according to the Supreme Court it can't

139
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,680
limit what private agents give to

140
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,359
candidates it can require the airwaves

141
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,199
the broadcast and cable networks to give

142
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,720
space for free to candidates that is

143
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,680
something absolutely conceivable

144
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,960
absolutely doable it can also when it

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,680
comes when we talk about the Press can

146
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:28,959
not only ensure uh public access to the

147
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,360
airwaves public broadcasting and so on

148
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,598
it can require a certain degree of TR

149
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,759
truthtellah and I say this not as an

150
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:39,478
active proposal but as a matter of

151
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,800
History uh Franklin Roosevelt of course

152
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,478
in his regulation of broadcasting back

153
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,199
in the 30s then radio but it was

154
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:50,038
inherited by the television industry uh

155
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,478
imposed a fairness Doctrine um uh which

156
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:55,159
essentially said both sides at least uh

157
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:58,038
need to be heard he also imposed a

158
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,280
public interest requirement each year

159
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:03,240
the television networks had to uh make a

160
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,918
case to the licensing board that they

161
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,519
had served the public interest um this

162
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,240
was usually taken to mean that the uh

163
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,439
news divisions of broadcast networks

164
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,639
would be protected from the profit

165
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,639
motive which is to say they were lost

166
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,478
leaders uh they spent a great deal of

167
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,079
money they did it the networks thought

168
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,199
well we have to do this to serve the

169
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,359
public interest now this was a real

170
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,160
thing that actually expired in real time

171
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,120
uh this expired under the Reagan

172
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,080
administ Administration um so these

173
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:39,079
things uh could very easily be put back

174
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:40,839
into effect uh there are a lot of other

175
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:42,800
obvious proposals we could make in which

176
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:45,959
the open society would become an

177
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,918
affirmative supporter uh of the common

178
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:52,519
good and a counterveiling

179
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:55,439
force uh to Market power um let me say

180
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:59,918
my time is short just make a couple of

181
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:01,800
uh a couple of brief um other points um

182
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,399
well let me make a final point which is

183
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,199
this uh George has suggested uh that

184
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,478
people need to divide their private

185
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,360
interests uh from their political

186
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,038
interests um He suggests he offers

187
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,680
himself as an example and it's a very

188
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,478
Vivid one um I would suggest though that

189
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,519
the proposal that we produce many many

190
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,918
George soros's and have a kind of Truth

191
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,399
telling Squad is going to be a very

192
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,598
difficult thing to do because he's an

193
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:33,199
unusual a very unusual person

194
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:36,278
uh I also think uh that trying to

195
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,680
establish a group of of of Truth tellers

196
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:40,719
uh compared yesterday to a a platonic

197
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,759
idea that is we're talking about

198
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,959
Guardians of the public good who would

199
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:49,240
be trained um uh to observe to critique

200
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,518
and to lead the Public Public will not

201
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,959
in the end be a practical idea I think

202
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,159
the AL the what and I will be interested

203
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,078
to hear his views of this what needs to

204
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:02,600
be done as a program of reformation

205
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:05,599
of the original conception of an open

206
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,879
Society uh and many of these proposals

207
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,240
are absolutely conceivable absolutely

208
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,799
doable President Obama has talked about

209
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,000
for example bringing back the fairness

210
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,078
Doctrine there's a great deal of

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,399
opposition to it and one should observe

212
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:19,319
that the very forces that you've

213
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,839
detailed so well uh and so richly in

214
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,560
your talk militate against the very

215
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,040
reforms that I am suggesting I

216
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,719
understand that nonetheless uh I am

217
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,519
optimistic about it and I would ask you

218
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,120
whether we shouldn't really be looking

219
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,519
for systemic reform uh more than uh

220
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,519
private reform thank

221
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,919
you I think we should go to um to ask

222
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,278
them to comment and we can go after I

223
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,120
will indeed okay uh George suggests that

224
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,958
we we ask uh the students and faculty at

225
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,519
Fudan University in Shanghai uh to begin

226
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,039
with their comments and so I say hello

227
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,039
to our friends in Shanghai and welcome

228
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,000
them uh invite them to ask the first

229
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,480
question okay hello from F University

230
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,360
Shanghai uh thanks a lot for this uh

231
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,759
fancinating uh lecture and I'm the local

232
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,278
uh facilitator and we already have three

233
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:19,278
questions two from faculty members and

234
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:23,639
one from student now now I am handing it

235
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,639
over to the first participant

236
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:40,639
oh okay yeah hello judge I'm wishing

237
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,559
leave from school of Economics I me to

238
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:48,159
you this uh

239
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:51,518
uh okay uh just one one questions uh one

240
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:54,639
question in the conclusion you said I

241
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,120
believe that if more people separated

242
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,440
their rule as political participants

243
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,000
from their rule of Market the

244
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,040
partipate the American democracy will

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,919
function better I I I I agree with your

246
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:13,240
your standpoint but uh I just wonder one

247
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,360
question that's uh if I'm not

248
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,959
misunderstand what you you

249
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:25,959
say if uh uh without the the re

250
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:28,638
representative democracy or in James be

251
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:31,919
J in the the constitu Democracy the

252
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:35,480
separation of two rules you proposed

253
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:39,719
could be implmented or not that's you

254
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,039
know just L that two rules is closely

255
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,560
linked together that's all the questions

256
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:47,039
of Chinese Society faced today that's my

257
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,359
question thank

258
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,759
you I I

259
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,240
believe he asked you got the question

260
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,278
about the separation of two worlds yes

261
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,839
it's a very interesting question you

262
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:03,799
might restate it for the audience uh uh

263
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:08,200
I for once I understood it very

264
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:11,159
well that I suggest separating the two

265
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,120
roles how how could that how should that

266
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:17,000
apply in

267
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,519
China uh where you don't have a

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,639
representative uh democracy and I think

269
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,679
it's a very very interesting question

270
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,759
and it's much more difficult I think to

271
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:30,599
apply it in in China because China is a

272
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:34,159
very efficient

273
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,800
system of decision making but it is

274
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:41,399
characterized by a much greater

275
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:44,559
political influence over uh economic

276
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:48,399
decisions that effectively investment

277
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:51,039
decisions are mainly Guided by uh

278
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,958
political considerations rather than by

279
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:59,599
the profit motive um and

280
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:04,479
uh it it is in many ways efficient but

281
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:09,320
the the problem then of uh of

282
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,680
using uh personally or making decisions

283
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,760
for personal interest rather than the

284
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:17,399
public interest is is very great the

285
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:21,399
Temptation and and of course uh

286
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:26,759
corruption is the the the big uh uh

287
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:31,519
factor in in China that limits uh the

288
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:34,720
success of the Chinese uh uh uh model uh

289
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,399
and and uh

290
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:42,480
uh it's it's really the the main the

291
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,240
main problem uh and I think that that

292
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,440
actually moving towards a more open

293
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:55,399
Society more open Society uh and giving

294
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:59,360
the people uh more uh uh uh rights to

295
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:03,120
stand up and to to uh Express their

296
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,639
views uh and establishing proper

297
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,959
channels establishing the rule of law

298
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:14,120
rather than the rule of

299
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:18,359
men uh is the direction in which China

300
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,320
needs to go in order to to actually to

301
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,639
improve the efficiency of investment

302
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:28,680
because it's remarkable how low the rate

303
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,600
of return on investment in China is it's

304
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:37,679
actually quite amazing given China's

305
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:40,800
success uh uh but then more than 50% of

306
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,519
the G&amp;P actually goes into investment

307
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,439
but the rate of return on that

308
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,600
investment is very

309
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:51,199
low given uh if you conceive of private

310
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,680
interests uh having a determining effect

311
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:58,639
on public policy as corruption uh if we

312
00:14:54,679 --> 00:15:01,599
Define it that way uh is China more

313
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,159
corrupt in the United

314
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,879
States

315
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:12,039
uh I would say that corruption is

316
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:16,639
endemic in in the system in in in in in

317
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:18,480
in the United States uh it's really

318
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,440
mainly in the

319
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:26,480
political uh

320
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:31,920
Arena that the the uh uh lobbying and

321
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:35,720
and and uh uh special interests

322
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:39,000
uh uh influencing the regulations that

323
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,920
are enacted that's where mainly the

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,278
Distortion comes into play whereas in

325
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:50,278
China it pervades the economic system

326
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,919
itself uh why don't we go to our second

327
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:55,360
question from Fudan

328
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:58,719
University Mr solos now we have the

329
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,839
second question hello this is up a

330
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,319
student student from un fan University

331
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,560
my question would be um agencies and

332
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:08,198
representatives somehow are made up and

333
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,119
most of the times of Elites and at the

334
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:12,719
same time your suggesting SE the

335
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,278
separation of the roles of the so

336
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,399
participants in the politics and

337
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:20,120
participants in the market was somehow

338
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,759
sent a negative message to those

339
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,560
Elites and which somehow indicated by

340
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:29,039
the history that we're going to see more

341
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:31,359
catastrophic effects as predicted Maybe

342
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,000
we would see more financial meltdowns in

343
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,240
the future so my question would be how

344
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,120
effect do you think your suggestion the

345
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,120
separation of roles would play in the

346
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,039
future thank you could you just repeat

347
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,919
the question I I think it's a question

348
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:48,399
about whether the separation of public

349
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,198
and private roles that you suggested

350
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,600
would play a distinctly negative role on

351
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:57,278
the elites and would have uh a negative

352
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,920
effect on their functioning as economic

353
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,439
agents that's how the he formed uh he

354
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,879
formed the question if you if you

355
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,400
separate it it will have a NE negative

356
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,520
effect on on Elites and playing their

357
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,919
role as economic uh agents of the

358
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:16,119
private

359
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,038
sector um I I I don't understand the

360
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,879
question

361
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:23,359
uh it doesn't make sense to me it could

362
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,559
be reconceived as do do the elites need

363
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,359
Market

364
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:30,279
fundamentalism uh and their influence on

365
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,639
the public sector uh to function

366
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,519
profitably they must they must be

367
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,440
motivated by self-interest in in order

368
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,160
to be making the rules I I don't see

369
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:45,120
that I think that that in a certainly in

370
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,600
a well functioning uh democracy that

371
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:51,119
that has not been the case well let me

372
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:53,719
put it in a different form if if what

373
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,038
your vision that you set out was inacted

374
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,839
would we be would we have as one final

375
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,839
result a more equal distribution of

376
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:07,159
wealth

377
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:10,839
um well I think that depends on on

378
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:13,760
the basically on the will of the the

379
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:16,918
electorate uh um well you mentioned the

380
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,079
estate tax which uh was abolished even

381
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,919
though it was absolutely contrary to the

382
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,720
interest of 99% of the population the

383
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,880
implication being If people really

384
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,839
understood what it involved embol it

385
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,240
would you are right actually

386
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:37,599
given the the influence of Market

387
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,519
fundamentalism uh the success of Market

388
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:46,879
fundamentalism uh In America which has

389
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:51,798
really kind of uh uh um skewed uh public

390
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:56,200
opinion uh against the their own

391
00:18:51,798 --> 00:19:00,200
interest uh as the I quoted the state

392
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:03,720
that text is a a very good example uh

393
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,759
certainly if you eliminated that and it

394
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,400
then I think the public interest would

395
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,400
be better served and presumably it would

396
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,600
lead to

397
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:19,120
a a u a more equal distribution of

398
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:22,399
wealth but but I don't want to prejudge

399
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:26,000
it because let's say I happen to be in

400
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,919
that camp politically that that would

401
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,880
favor a more equal uh uh a distribution

402
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,159
but I don't want to impose my judgment

403
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,520
and claim it that that's how open

404
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:41,880
Society has to be I think it that is

405
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:44,079
really up to the people in the in in in

406
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,720
the Democracy concerned to make that

407
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,158
decision I I would press you just a

408
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,038
little on that before going back to

409
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,000
Fudan because isn't that a bit of an

410
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,279
imposed neutrality I mean really what

411
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,519
you're saying is that the public

412
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,798
interest should be more equitably

413
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,798
represented uh the broader public

414
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:02,679
interest and I would I think that would

415
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,599
suggest uh that the great concentrations

416
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,840
of wealth we've seen in recent years

417
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:13,240
would to some extent be reversed no

418
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:18,199
well look again the the the

419
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:21,798
evidence points points are that that the

420
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,640
the the uh differences in income have

421
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:27,119
tremendously increased in the last 25

422
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,280
years when Market fundamentalism has

423
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:34,479
become the dominant

424
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:40,558
greed uh and in fact the average has not

425
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:44,720
benefited it it's it's really the top

426
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:47,879
that uh one or 2% of the population that

427
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,880
gathered all the extra revenues that

428
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,240
came from benefit so that's and

429
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,240
therefore if you reversed it presumably

430
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,960
it would go the other way but I still

431
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,720
don't think I just don't want to I agree

432
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,919
with that argument but I don't want to

433
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:10,159
to pose that as sort of the the the open

434
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:13,720
Society because I would be prejudging it

435
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,039
which is not appropriate we'll go back

436
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,440
now to Fang University in Shanghai third

437
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,960
question okay thank you very much and

438
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,759
the third question from myself uh my

439
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,120
name is p associate professor in sko

440
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:29,919
management fan University I think the

441
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,359
title of the lecture is ISM versus open

442
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,000
society and one of the central me

443
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,278
messages con conveyed from this lecture

444
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,759
seems that the rise of Market

445
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:42,359
fundamentalism is a major threat to open

446
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:46,079
Society so my question is what's the

447
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:48,319
relationship between capitalism and

448
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:52,000
Market fundamentalism and putting

449
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:55,599
another way uh under what conditions

450
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,759
under what circumstances the roid will

451
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,918
uh Mark fundamentalism will develop and

452
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,919
even flourish in a capitalist Society

453
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,400
thank you could you repeat that well I

454
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,240
thought he was getting and I may have

455
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,600
misunderstood uh to the fact that

456
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,240
capitalism doesn't necessarily need

457
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:17,719
democracy as a partner um that is what I

458
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,079
understood the beginning of the question

459
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,679
meant uh that in fact and he is coming

460
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,558
of course from Shanghai uh one of the

461
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,240
most powerful cities in a country that

462
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,839
is both vividly capitalist and NE

463
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,558
non-democratic

464
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:32,558
uh but I afraid I didn't understand the

465
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,480
very last line of the question maybe

466
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,240
maybe you could repeat it I simply

467
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,640
didn't understand what you said the last

468
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,480
line just the last line Market Market

469
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,840
fundamentalism may not uh develop quite

470
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,440
fastly in uh capitalist Society because

471
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:50,439
uh uh Market fundamentalism is not equal

472
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,038
to capitalism so uh but you in the

473
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,640
lecture you say that in in in in the

474
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:58,720
United States Market fundamentalism even

475
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,400
flourish over the last several decades

476
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,200
uh in such a particular capitalist

477
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,640
Society so my question is under what

478
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,960
conditions or under what circumstances

479
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,159
Market fundament mentalism will develop

480
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,798
a flourish in a capitalist Society after

481
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,720
under under what situations does Market

482
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,798
fundamentalism flourish in capitalist

483
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,000
societies relationship between

484
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,240
capitalism and Market fundamentalism how

485
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,679
are they

486
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,159
different look thank you yeah thank you

487
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,919
very much for the

488
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,600
question it's a very good question uh I

489
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,320
don't think that market

490
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:42,719
fundamentalism has served capitalism or

491
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:47,119
or even the the people who espouse that

492
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:50,640
philosophy or ideology uh very well

493
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:55,798
because as as I tried to argue in my

494
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:59,000
previous uh uh uh lectures it is it has

495
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:02,720
been responsible for the Super Bubble

496
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,159
which burst with with with tremendous

497
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:12,319
damage to the American uh

498
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:16,440
economy uh and um I think that for

499
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:21,278
instance right now after the bursting of

500
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:24,720
the bubble when the um Financial system

501
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:29,240
is being allowed to earn its way out of

502
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,880
a hole to re re rebuild its capital

503
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:37,798
through hidden

504
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:42,159
subsidies um uh by keeping making U uh

505
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:45,079
uh um Capital available financing

506
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,000
available from the central bank as zero

507
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:52,519
cost when you can then invest Banks can

508
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,599
invest it with no risk whatsoever into

509
00:24:52,519 --> 00:25:00,038
government bonds earning 3 and a half%

510
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:04,798
and not actually requiring uh uh uh any

511
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:06,679
uh uh uh Capital reserves to do that so

512
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:12,119
they are being

513
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:15,240
effectively given over a a hidden

514
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:20,798
subsidy and at the same time the banks

515
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:25,159
are now uh paying very large Bon bonuses

516
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:28,599
to their uh uh employees who are

517
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,240
supposed to be generating those earnings

518
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:33,959
by taking risks successfully in know

519
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,960
words making the right decisions here

520
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,440
they they are just benefiting from a

521
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,360
hidden subsidy and I think it's a big

522
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,840
mistake for them actually to use that

523
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:49,678
money in that way because it generates

524
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:54,439
public resentment so I think it's a very

525
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:57,240
uh shortsighted view uh on the part of

526
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,798
of of uh the mar Market

527
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,919
fundamentalists to persist in in in in

528
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:06,798
the putting their their uh private

529
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,240
interests ahead of the public interest

530
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,879
I'd like to to thank our uh participants

531
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,440
at Fudan University back later maybe we

532
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,760
will come back at the end we'll throw uh

533
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,480
the questions now uh open to the floor

534
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,119
and as we um reach one I'm going to ask

535
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,440
you one quick question to bridge bridge

536
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,959
this which is the policy that you just

537
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,919
identified that the Obama regime has or

538
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:35,720
the ex Administration excuse me has

539
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:39,000
pursued um uh was it the result of too

540
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,399
much private interest on public policy

541
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,640
did they make this decision as a result

542
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:48,199
of the influence of capital or uh did

543
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,799
they simply not know how to uh uh take

544
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,919
the other course that you described well

545
00:26:50,798 --> 00:27:01,038
I think there two elements uh uh one

546
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:03,679
that that um uh they basically judged it

547
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,200
was a it was a conscious political

548
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,519
decision because there was this

549
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,960
alternative you for Simplicity sake you

550
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:15,759
may call it the the the Scandinavian

551
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,200
solution and the Japanese solution

552
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,839
because the Scandinavians

553
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,200
effectively uh uh nationalized their

554
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,759
Banks

555
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,558
temporarily and they they they got out

556
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:32,000
of a crisis pretty fast and of course

557
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:35,519
denationalize the banks whereas the

558
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,480
Japanese uh supported their banking

559
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:41,319
system through hidden subsidies and

560
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,319
basically the Obama

561
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:47,918
Administration uh decided to go the

562
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:51,918
Japanese uh route and that was partly I

563
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:54,960
think a conscious decision uh to that

564
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,399
politically it would be unacceptable

565
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,759
that in fact this anti-government

566
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:05,639
uh uh sentiment in and tradition in

567
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:11,200
America is too strong for them to go

568
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:16,360
against it um and secondly I think it in

569
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:22,840
a way the the there was a certain

570
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:27,278
sequence uh the crisis hit the previous

571
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:31,519
administration took this road uh um of

572
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:34,640
indir sub CES and they

573
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:38,278
didn't they weren't prepared with the

574
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,679
alternative so uh uh continuity dragged

575
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:46,359
them in so partly it was deliberate and

576
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:49,440
partly it was just the the shortness of

577
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:51,519
time or time pressure that led to that

578
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,000
and partly out of not wanting to oppose

579
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,960
the ideological beliefs of the American

580
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,398
and of course Obama wanted to be the

581
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,038
Great uniter and did not want to have

582
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:07,719
sort of

583
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:10,759
U impose a start off by being too

584
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,120
critical of what went be before and I

585
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,519
think that was a mistake because you

586
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:20,158
have had 25 years of

587
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:25,798
accumulated uh uh excess that came home

588
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:29,440
to roost uh but by claiming to arrest

589
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:31,440
the decline he has actually now taking

590
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,759
possession and there is an aru an

591
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,320
argument for doing the most the heaviest

592
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,278
lifting politically at the beginning

593
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:40,798
when you have the greatest political

594
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:44,880
Capital right um uh

595
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:47,879
questions um sir over there wait for the

596
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,640
microphone please and tell us your name

597
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,640
my name is George copit and I'm a

598
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,440
chairman of the fiscal Council in the

599
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,240
Republic of Hungary and I also lecture

600
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,080
at your University Central European

601
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,038
University in Budapest first of all I

602
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:06,038
would like to start by thanking George

603
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:08,558
choros for an extremely stimulating and

604
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:11,798
thought-provoking uh uh

605
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:14,879
presentation and I and then thereafter I

606
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:17,759
would like to just uh take a little bit

607
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,840
of an issue with your observation of the

608
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:24,079
US uh agency problem through the last 50

609
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,359
years or the last 100 years there was a

610
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,960
an observer of the US Senate in the

611
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:33,879
early I don't remember who it was manen

612
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:37,278
or who it was who uh observed that the

613
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,159
price of a senator in the US was about

614
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:42,359
$1,000 of course it was much more

615
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,240
today's prices than than what it is

616
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:48,719
today right but anyway uh there was

617
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,599
certainly a lot of agency problem uh in

618
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,319
the early part and in the course of the

619
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:58,038
I don't think that it's we are any uh

620
00:30:53,319 --> 00:31:00,038
less moral uh or less corrupt Society

621
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:03,278
today as at the beginning of the century

622
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:06,000
but we could go on with that in any case

623
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:08,919
a you refer to the fact that you need

624
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,359
checks and balances in fact a lot of

625
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:15,600
institutional uh framework made up of a

626
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:18,678
lot of uh Watchdogs to watch over the

627
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:21,359
honesty of government and certainly in

628
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:23,759
the US there has been a lot of

629
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:27,079
Institutions created since that time in

630
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,558
the course of even the last 50 years but

631
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:30,720
going further back back the Federal

632
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,440
Trade Commission Securities and Exchange

633
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,519
Commission uh

634
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,038
1975 the Congressional budget office and

635
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,599
then of course even before the general

636
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,679
Accounting Office which then became the

637
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:43,798
general accountability office all of

638
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:47,440
this to serve precisely the purpose that

639
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:50,480
you have described in fact we in Hungary

640
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,278
and myself I'm heading a very new

641
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,278
institution which is more or less

642
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:58,240
patterned after the Congressional budget

643
00:31:54,278 --> 00:32:01,558
office to keep the government honest in

644
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,839
fiscal policy but my question really is

645
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:07,440
looking forward a little bit and drawing

646
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:10,439
from already some of your remarks today

647
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,360
and elsewhere in media what sort of

648
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,600
Institutions do you think would really

649
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:20,240
uh serve the US and of course we could

650
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:23,359
extend that onto Europe what sort of

651
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,759
Institutions would really serve uh this

652
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:28,839
extremely useful purpose of watching

653
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,919
over the financial system if you could

654
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:32,959
it's it's what institutions what sort of

655
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,038
Institutions would serve the purpose of

656
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,440
watching over the financial institutions

657
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:42,879
look I I think that America actually has

658
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:47,240
all the institutions that it needs it

659
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:50,480
really has a wonderful Constitution that

660
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,359
in spite of a few uh maybe things where

661
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:58,079
it's maybe out of date uh uh like the

662
00:32:54,359 --> 00:33:03,678
first amendment stands in the way of uh

663
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:07,038
uh of uh uh controlling uh uh spending

664
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,480
on elections and things like that uh

665
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:12,839
which the founding fathers didn't

666
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,960
anticipate couldn't anticipate 200 years

667
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:18,158
uh in advance so there are a few things

668
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,120
like that but on the whole the

669
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,720
institutions are really there uh it's

670
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:27,239
really the

671
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:31,558
values that I think have gotten skewed

672
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:34,038
and and distorted through this the the

673
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:37,119
Triumph of Market

674
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:40,480
fundamentalism and the and I've pointed

675
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:43,918
out the contradictions the the internal

676
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,599
contradictions in in those values so I

677
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,080
hold values responsible not institutions

678
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:54,240
I think we've got the institutions we

679
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:56,638
did in contrast let's say to countries

680
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,919
in Eastern Europe which are relatively

681
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:03,278
Young and the institutions are not

682
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,278
strong enough questions yes

683
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:09,440
sir there's the microphone

684
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:15,918
after I'm Fred branman I'm I'm a writer

685
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,000
I used to work with Excuse me with folks

686
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,118
Like Larry Summers and Paul Krugman and

687
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,960
so forth and concluded then and and have

688
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,919
seen nothing to uh change it sense that

689
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,960
that and I'm curious what you think of

690
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:32,598
this that we've ventured a phase of late

691
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,440
late capitalism High debts uncompetitive

692
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:37,399
industry uh major financial institutions

693
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,200
which no longer serve the the public

694
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:41,000
interest which make our previous

695
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:44,239
economic theories that worked in the

696
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,679
past irrelevant today fundamentally and

697
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:50,719
that America cannot grow uh as it's

698
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:53,200
grown in the past and that therefore um

699
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:56,239
we really have no choice but but to

700
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,919
start thinking about accepting that fact

701
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,118
accepting that the real model for

702
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,079
America the future has to be a European

703
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,960
style welfare state if it can't grow as

704
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,880
it has in the past and if it's not going

705
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,440
to fall apart into war in camps uh that

706
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,280
we need to start promoting values of at

707
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,599
least voluntary Simplicity if not um

708
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,839
just accepting that we're all going to

709
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,960
have to live more simply uh we are going

710
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:21,320
to have to have a major redistribution

711
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,720
of wealth and fundamentally change the

712
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,200
very image of where we're heading rather

713
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:28,279
than as I think we are now doing hoping

714
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:30,559
to recover the past

715
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,680
uh one last comment on that is I think

716
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,119
when you really look at the level of

717
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:37,039
debt that we've taken out and the fact

718
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,519
that we simply can't repay it under any

719
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,880
conceivable scenario for the next 10 or

720
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,358
20 years without a very robust set of

721
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,200
industries that are bringing New Wealth

722
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,039
into America which we can't see and we

723
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:50,279
think of what must be done to solve

724
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:52,400
global warming uh and to deal with an

725
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,040
aging uh Baby Boom generation that's

726
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,960
going to eat up an increasing uh uh

727
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,480
amount of or need an increasing amount

728
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,000
of entitlement

729
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,599
I wonder what you think of this notion

730
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,239
that we really have to stop Clos with

731
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:06,240
the past except we're in a late

732
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,759
capitalist phase and start thinking of

733
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,519
totally new solutions to which the old

734
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,319
Solutions are relevant thank I I think

735
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,239
we get the idea are we in a late

736
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:17,199
capitalist phase that can only be

737
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:19,679
confronted with a European welfare style

738
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:24,598
system and a major redistribution of

739
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:27,799
wealth no look that's your view uh uh

740
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,440
but it's not it's not necessarily

741
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:36,880
the the the view in

742
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:40,159
America uh and uh to to to say

743
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,559
that I mean you're right in the sense

744
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:48,000
that that the

745
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:51,838
European welfare state has actually uh

746
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,239
weathered this storm uh uh very well

747
00:36:51,838 --> 00:37:00,639
compared to the United States uh and

748
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:03,559
while people particularly in America uh

749
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:07,759
used to be very critical of the welfare

750
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:12,279
state and the relatively low rate of of

751
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,370
of growth me as measured in in

752
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,200
GNP uh

753
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:18,078
[Music]

754
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:22,399
um

755
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:25,359
effectively uh there has been a payoff

756
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,960
because the automatic stabilizers have

757
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:32,960
actually really done done that job job

758
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:37,838
uh and hopefully this will influence

759
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:42,599
American opinion uh looking forward but

760
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:45,318
I as I say I think you are sort of uh

761
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,720
seeking to impose your views on America

762
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:49,199
and I don't don't think that's a

763
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,959
practical proposition uh next question

764
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,838
is in the second row here can you bring

765
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,679
the microphone

766
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:57,559
please and then and then back there

767
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:01,159
thank you

768
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:05,159
Mr Shores in the framework of an open

769
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:08,399
Society how do we analyze Mr Obama's

770
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:08,399
health program

771
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,599
proposition uh how would you analyze

772
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,799
President Obama's health proposition

773
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,480
particularly with uh respect to the

774
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,560
prosperity and problems in the in the

775
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,440
economy well I I'm I've been very I've

776
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:28,199
been quite distressed uh by by the

777
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,639
debate uh because the the

778
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,519
unfortunately the health system proposed

779
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:38,279
by

780
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:44,039
Obama uh really is not designed uh uh to

781
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:46,720
provide Health it's designed to pay for

782
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:51,480
procedures and it encourages then

783
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:54,358
procedures not preservation or uh

784
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:59,719
promotion of Health uh so it's

785
00:38:54,358 --> 00:39:02,920
fundamentally flawed and I have no doubt

786
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:06,199
that what you need is is a National

787
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:09,559
Health Service a single provider because

788
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:12,759
only a single provider can uh be

789
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:18,039
concerned about prevention as distinct

790
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:20,720
from treating uh uh uh disease uh but

791
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:23,719
that is a non-starter as I said in my

792
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:25,879
lecture this is absolutely National

793
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:30,639
Health

794
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:36,480
socialism is is is has been uh

795
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:38,799
outlawed in in America uh I think I find

796
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,679
that rather distressing may I ask a

797
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,839
followup here why if indeed everyone is

798
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,519
insured and if it's in the interest of

799
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,759
health insurance companies since they

800
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,000
can't reject people when they're sick to

801
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,000
have them healthier because they will

802
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,920
then spend less money curing them why

803
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,838
canot the system Obama is uh now

804
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,318
champing also

805
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:04,799
Value Health because because the the

806
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:07,279
people can move from one to provider to

807
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,680
another so you don't have the if you

808
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,280
have one

809
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:15,559
provider then the

810
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,240
provider is concerned about having fewer

811
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:22,279
procedures uh

812
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:26,078
um in if you have many providers you

813
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,599
don't have the same situation so I I

814
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:34,880
think quite a apart from the fact also

815
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:39,519
that having the the U uh insurance

816
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,559
companies uh uh compete with each other

817
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:44,800
the only way they can improve their

818
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:47,358
profits is actually by denying uh

819
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,680
benefits so you've got the wrong

820
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,679
incentives built into the system okay

821
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:55,358
back

822
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:57,759
there my name is ulia V and I'm a

823
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:00,159
journalist a Hungarian journalist and if

824
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,800
you don't mind uh I stay a little bit in

825
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:06,799
this country uh even if we have 20 years

826
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,119
of so-called democracy and capitalism we

827
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,440
are beginners and therefore my question

828
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,240
might be naive but uh do you think there

829
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,440
is

830
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:18,118
anybody uh maybe you are the only one I

831
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,720
think who could

832
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:26,358
convince uh people who are playing role

833
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:29,199
in the market not to in be influenced by

834
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:32,440
politics or or people who are playing a

835
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:36,399
role in politics not to try to influence

836
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,240
the market I agree with Mr Danner that

837
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,079
George churos should be multiplied but

838
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:45,479
until he's not uh I doubt that there are

839
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:50,440
uh too many people who can be convinced

840
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:53,920
about uh the so-called open Society uh

841
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,679
this phenomenon we are waiting for so

842
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,960
much thank you how do you convince

843
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:02,000
people uh given that there aren't you

844
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,679
can't multiply George Soros how do you

845
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,400
convince people to separate their

846
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:10,199
private interests and their public

847
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:14,440
interest well by giving a lecture like

848
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:14,439
this is everybody in the room

849
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,200
convinced is is that the answer Moral

850
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:25,119
Moral suasion that is what

851
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:27,679
else I mean hope hopefully arguments can

852
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,680
still convince people

853
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,078
we we hope that is the case uh let's see

854
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,719
uh gentleman in the front here there was

855
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:37,440
people there yes and we'll go we'll go

856
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:39,919
over to the side

857
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,880
next Howard Robinson central European

858
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,559
University and it's really a followup on

859
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,559
the last question you emphasized as it

860
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,280
were the division within individuals but

861
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:51,519
a certain kind of platonism and

862
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,359
oldfashioned tourism also had that a

863
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,880
division between certain classes of

864
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:58,960
person so in Disraeli Cil for example

865
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,800
you have a civilized commercial Society

866
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,679
because the aristocracy the church and

867
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,960
the monarchy don't have Direct

868
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:07,039
commercial values in England this was

869
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,079
passed on through the public schools to

870
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,400
the middle class and the professions and

871
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:13,880
with keynesianism to the state sector is

872
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,599
there any way of restoring not merely

873
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,838
hoping people will be schizophrenically

874
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,240
honest but having whole sectors of

875
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,838
society who don't from moment to moment

876
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,479
make all their decisions on Commercial

877
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,838
basis Mrs Thatcher destroyed that in

878
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,358
Britain how can we restore

879
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:32,279
that how can can we restore uh parts of

880
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:34,078
society like the church the aristocracy

881
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,000
that have built built into their

882
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,079
Traditions a societal responsibility

883
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,159
divorced from pursuit of gain and

884
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:45,839
pursuit of wealth yeah I mean I don't

885
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:51,358
believe that you can you know uh uh this

886
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:53,960
uh trap of uh of idealizing the past uh

887
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:57,239
I try to resist it I can't totally

888
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,519
resist it uh because I see a deterior

889
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:01,279
ation in our values uh but I think we

890
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:06,039
need

891
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:10,920
to re reconstitute it in in some new

892
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:12,279
form and not hug back to to to the past

893
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,920
it was

894
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:19,519
actually I think the case of British

895
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:23,079
democracy the

896
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:26,480
um the aristocracy played a very

897
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:27,599
positive uh role but that was that

898
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,639
particular

899
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,680
historic situation so I think we need to

900
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:38,159
create a new one and I think it's not

901
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:42,000
impossible on this side yes right

902
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,759
there Ellen Hume from ceu I wanted to go

903
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,880
back to the question that we got from

904
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,720
China which I don't think was fully

905
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,640
recognized which is why is Market

906
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:55,719
fundamentalism so powerful in the states

907
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:58,000
how did it become the the the current

908
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:00,358
philosophy that so strong wrong and

909
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,800
could there be circumstances that it

910
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:05,279
might happen for example in China as

911
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,359
well how do we look for the Hallmarks

912
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,359
that create this Market fundamentalism

913
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:13,639
that you find so negative no look I I

914
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:17,960
tried to explain in my lecture

915
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:22,719
that the main I think the main power of

916
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:27,240
maret fundamentalism has been the very

917
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:32,078
well finan financed propaganda

918
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:36,078
uh uh and in fact uh there's been U some

919
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:42,160
studies that showed how seven

920
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:45,359
foundations played a very big role in

921
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:47,960
spreading the market values to areas

922
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,799
where they don't belong as for instance

923
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,880
uh law and economics and uh there a

924
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,160
there a typical example that was

925
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,240
basically

926
00:45:54,159 --> 00:46:04,078
introduced uh uh by Financial uh

927
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:07,558
support for that approach uh so I I

928
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:10,839
think that's that is in my opinion why

929
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:15,800
it has been so successful and I think

930
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:19,519
that this moment when it has so

931
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,519
conspicuously uh done so much damage uh

932
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:25,920
because of its

933
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:30,480
instability uh um is the moment to bring

934
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,318
home that it has in fact failed and we

935
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,639
have to abandon it I I think it is worth

936
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:38,239
pointing out that this was in a sense a

937
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:40,279
premeditated decision brought about by

938
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:43,558
the Powell memo and certain other things

939
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,519
by think tanks to spread this um one

940
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,599
should also mention I think the the high

941
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,159
inflation and terrible economic

942
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,480
situation at the end of The Carter

943
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:54,480
Administration which Le led the ground

944
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:58,079
for the acceptance of this sort of uh

945
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:03,280
radical view of of capitalism yeah well

946
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:06,480
the the inflation of the S of the 70s

947
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,720
has had uh the effect of discrediting

948
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,159
Keynesian

949
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:16,919
economics and allowing the monetarist

950
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:19,358
and and and efficient market hypothesis

951
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:23,400
Etc to come to the

952
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:26,199
four yes uh on yes

953
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,519
sir then we'll go to the I'm G Kasper

954
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,239
the trustee

955
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:32,960
uh uh George I would like to comment on

956
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,598
your last point and really disagree with

957
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,720
you to a very large extent yes there

958
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,680
were those foundations Olan and so on uh

959
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:44,719
that gave money to

960
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:47,480
universities but I think that is

961
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:50,719
actually a very misleading understanding

962
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:53,400
of what really happened and uh Robert

963
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:56,480
skidelsky in a new book that he just

964
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,519
published weeks ago uh is taking a

965
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,880
difference intake he is saying it's

966
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:03,759
really the power of ideas and lots of

967
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,880
the ideas we now associate with The

968
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:10,920
Chicago School were very powerful many

969
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:14,200
of the participants remained ordinary

970
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:17,400
relatively poor in Gentile poverty to be

971
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:20,358
sure but relatively poor academics that

972
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,440
was never the issue but these ideas seem

973
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:26,119
to have a tremendous attraction because

974
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,960
they seem to work for a whole variety of

975
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:33,358
problems including the Assumption of uh

976
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,519
uh the rational consumer and so on now I

977
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:38,920
happen to agree with most of your

978
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:41,239
criticisms but I think the notion uh

979
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,880
that it is was a kind of conspiracy on

980
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:46,439
the part of belthy Foundations misleads

981
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:49,640
us completely yesterday there was

982
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,838
reference to the platonic uh uh Elites

983
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:54,159
and where you not going back to it well

984
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:55,960
the Dismal news is there are Elites

985
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,440
there are platonic Elites and it could

986
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,798
be the Chicago School of economics and

987
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,240
so we could indeed go in totally

988
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:07,039
undesirable directions and we should uh

989
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:09,000
for stall that and since I do have the

990
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,318
not the if not the podium the microphone

991
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,760
I would like to go back uh to the

992
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:16,400
earlier question about

993
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,119
institutions I really do I do believe

994
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,079
what you are doing this lecture uh

995
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:24,720
preaching as it were is very important

996
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,839
and needs to be done but in the end it

997
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:30,639
is only the quality of our institutions

998
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:33,838
and the engagement in these institutions

999
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:35,838
the journalists who are permanently uh

1000
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,358
drumming and saying hey you're not doing

1001
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,279
it right you are keeping information

1002
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:43,880
from us and so on and so on that will

1003
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:46,760
get us improvements I I I think hoping

1004
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,559
for the day when the ordinary citizen

1005
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,599
will

1006
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:53,559
overcome uh self-interest and will act

1007
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,720
only in the public interest assuming we

1008
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:59,000
can Define it the public interest big

1009
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,199
you are yourself are very reluctant

1010
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,318
actually in many areas to Define what

1011
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:07,838
the public interest is only then uh I

1012
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:10,759
would put my trust in those Solutions

1013
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:12,679
rather than in uh a big moral

1014
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,119
reformation and that you know that

1015
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:17,679
includes Hungary too I I will seize the

1016
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,200
chance to self-interestedly put forward

1017
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,879
the critiques because they follow

1018
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:24,879
directly from what you said that I uh

1019
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,920
put forward in my uh my remarks which is

1020
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,079
are there not institutions that could be

1021
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,119
encouraged aggressively uh to be

1022
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:34,960
renovated in effect because many of them

1023
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,920
already exist uh that can at least help

1024
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,199
the moral suasion you're talking about

1025
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,720
I'm talking about the fairness Doctrine

1026
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,679
uh electoral reform uh limitation on

1027
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:45,358
campaign spending public spending on

1028
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,239
campaigns a lot of the problems you

1029
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:51,719
pointed to do have uh conceivable

1030
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:55,798
Solutions Beyond persuasion in the moral

1031
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:57,480
realm undoubtedly there there are there

1032
00:50:55,798 --> 00:51:01,318
are reforms

1033
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:05,880
certainly a campaign Finance reform is

1034
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:09,838
very much needed but the the fact is

1035
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:13,680
that you know every reform uh has some

1036
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:15,400
flaw in it and I was a supporter of

1037
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:17,159
campaign Finance

1038
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,920
reform

1039
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:24,598
um particular aspects of it and so on

1040
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,559
but I also gave a grant to um the New

1041
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,200
York

1042
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:32,480
University Rance Center and I

1043
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:37,199
said I would want you to study the

1044
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:40,199
flaws the potential flaws in the reform

1045
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:44,798
proposals that part of the grant was

1046
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:48,078
actually never used in

1047
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:52,719
was they didn't actually do a very good

1048
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:56,039
job in I mean we have to recognize that

1049
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:59,399
all our arrangements are flawed and this

1050
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:02,400
is the Human Condition and of course you

1051
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,760
are you're right that that Chicago

1052
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,280
school had a

1053
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,920
tremendous uh

1054
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,640
intellectual power and and

1055
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:18,680
influence

1056
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:23,159
um but you see the a a school of thought

1057
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:26,759
which basically said that government is

1058
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:27,960
bad actually leads to bad government so

1059
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,960
there is this

1060
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:34,880
reflexive connection as well in other

1061
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:39,798
words there are booms and busts

1062
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:43,039
in in in in intellectual in intellectual

1063
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:45,599
development so canes for instance had a

1064
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,880
tremendous

1065
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:51,599
Boom the

1066
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:54,519
keynesians were did not have actually

1067
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:57,480
the the subtlety of Mind of

1068
00:52:54,519 --> 00:53:00,719
canes uh just as Mark

1069
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:04,280
didn't quite have you know Marxist

1070
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:08,919
intelligence either who could could so

1071
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:13,240
so uh kism got a little bit

1072
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:16,440
overdone and and uh and basically KES

1073
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:19,719
proposed his theory at a time of

1074
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:23,318
depression when when the lack of demand

1075
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:27,199
was the problem and therefore his

1076
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:33,079
prescription uh uh involved public

1077
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:36,358
expanding uh and he did not uh

1078
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:39,400
propose uh anything much in the way of

1079
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:42,960
arresting inflation had he lived in the

1080
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:46,160
70s I confident he would have recognize

1081
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,798
the problem of inflation it was inherent

1082
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:51,598
in his general theory that that

1083
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:54,920
equilibrium will not give you the

1084
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:57,480
optimum that there are less than Optimum

1085
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:00,400
uh uh Arrangements that can Prevail he

1086
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:04,400
called them equilibria and of course

1087
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:07,200
today even today we talk about multiple

1088
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,480
equilibria which to my my mind means

1089
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,039
that sometimes you're in disequilibrium

1090
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,400
I call it

1091
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,558
disequilibrium uh so I think he would

1092
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,000
have dealt with with with with with

1093
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,240
inflation but because he didn't

1094
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:28,559
monetarism uh came back into Vogue

1095
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:33,239
Milton Friedman uh was tremendous ly

1096
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:36,640
influential uh and and actually that was

1097
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:39,199
a Revival of the monetarist theory that

1098
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:42,798
prevailed in the

1099
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:45,519
1920s which then led to the great crash

1100
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,798
was discredited by it so there has been

1101
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,920
a little bit of a repetition in history

1102
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:54,318
well and just the way the late 70s

1103
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,960
discredited to some extent canes right

1104
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:59,239
right thank you very much my name is

1105
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,119
Cecilia bujer and I'm the Swedish

1106
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:05,639
Ambassador here in

1107
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:10,039
Hungary I think that my country is

1108
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:14,440
possibly a good example of uh where you

1109
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:18,759
have parted the uh Market sphere and the

1110
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:20,798
political sphere as you call it uh and I

1111
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:24,280
would personally argue that that's one

1112
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:27,000
of the reasons why we have been

1113
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,960
relatively prosperous over long period

1114
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,679
of

1115
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:37,400
time however we see almost the opposite

1116
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:41,000
Trend in Sweden from your suggestion and

1117
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:44,838
that is that we are having more Market

1118
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,039
influence in the political square and uh

1119
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:49,838
in some parts more uh political

1120
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:54,400
influence in the market

1121
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:59,279
sphere so my question to you would be

1122
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:02,639
how do you Ensure uh an efficient use of

1123
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:08,039
resources in the political sphere if you

1124
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:13,358
don't have Market principles or Market

1125
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:16,559
ideas uh guiding uh the use of public

1126
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:20,519
funds and the other side is how do you

1127
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:23,599
make sure that the market side or the

1128
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:27,838
capitalistic side is taking

1129
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:31,960
responsibility for public common uh

1130
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:34,880
interests and goods if you do not have

1131
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:37,000
political influence in this SAR and I'm

1132
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,400
thinking about the environment and the

1133
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,960
climate of course a very big question

1134
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,039
thank you Ambassador um I'm reminded we

1135
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,199
have four minutes left so if you can

1136
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:51,480
begin to answer

1137
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:56,000
that please don't misunder understand me

1138
00:56:51,480 --> 00:57:00,960
in being in any way opposed to markets I

1139
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:05,480
think markets are really a wonderful

1140
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:09,318
instrument for for allowing adjustments

1141
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:13,599
allowing feedback in particular uh uh

1142
00:57:09,318 --> 00:57:15,119
very important that is neglected uh

1143
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:20,039
uh

1144
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:24,160
so actually I argued in my lecture for

1145
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:27,280
the great for the minimum intervention

1146
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:30,078
from government in in form of Regulation

1147
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,240
and intervention in the economy one

1148
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,519
should give whatever the markets can do

1149
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:38,679
should be allowed to do it because they

1150
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:40,280
they do it much much better than than

1151
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:43,480
governments can then you you would do

1152
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,480
less than than the swedes do presuma uh

1153
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,159
well I don't want to go into the Swedish

1154
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:51,280
situation because I don't know it well

1155
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:53,798
enough but uh but um

1156
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,680
uh it's

1157
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:59,480
very markets have a role

1158
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:03,358
but they they there are there's also a

1159
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:09,079
need for political decisions and markets

1160
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:13,199
are not designed to to make those social

1161
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:16,720
choices it's markets are for exchange

1162
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:20,239
among Market participants and there are

1163
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:22,838
social needs and public goods and so on

1164
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:25,399
which need to be provided by a political

1165
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:30,000
process and generally as I argued in my

1166
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:32,280
lecture uh um uh markets are actually

1167
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,719
more efficient than the political

1168
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:37,519
process therefore we should leave it to

1169
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:40,199
them what they can do but to to claim

1170
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:42,159
that they can do everything just because

1171
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:45,159
they are more efficient is an

1172
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:47,920
exaggeration that has cost us very deep

1173
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:50,199
very dearly does anyone have a one-

1174
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,240
sentence question we have uh we have two

1175
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:57,719
minutes left I need your commitment to

1176
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:57,719
one sentence yes sir you get the prize

1177
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,480
Julius haran Central

1178
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:04,880
University can you comment on the

1179
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:08,000
relationship of Market fundamentalism

1180
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,920
and the fall of communism because that

1181
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,119
the relationship between Market

1182
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:20,280
fundamentalism and the fall of Communism

1183
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:23,559
one one well uh you know uh um the fall

1184
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,680
of fall of disintegration of the Soviet

1185
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:30,280
Empire was could be interpreted either

1186
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:33,078
as the Triumph of capitalism or the

1187
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:36,480
Triumph of open society and there were

1188
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:39,559
these two approaches and

1189
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:42,838
actually I I took it to be the victory

1190
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:47,280
of open Society over close Society

1191
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:50,159
others like VAV klous saw it as the

1192
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:54,360
victory of capitalism

1193
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:56,559
over uh of course I would argue my case

1194
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,670
[Laughter]

1195
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,610
[Applause]

many ways our most

1205
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:30,000
thought-provoking and debate provoking

1206
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:32,838
lecture by our distinguished lecturer

1211
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:48,838
and he will show the way forward from

1212
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:51,480
our current enormous set of dilemas

1213

crises and problems in many dimensions

1214
