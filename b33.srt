1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:07,120
I know that the principle of fallibility

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,320
and reflexivity is against making

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,879
predictions so I'll try to make a

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,519
prediction anyway and my prediction is

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,039
that everybody who is interested in the

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,439
thinking of George Soros should come

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,480
back to these lectures I do believe this

8
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:24,920
was uh one of the most intensive type of

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,679
rethinking your all Philosophy for the

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,039
last 20 years and nothing has done more

11
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:31,719
than on the concept of open Society I

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,920
have been rereading yesterday the book

13
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:38,558
opening the Soviet system that he been

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,120
basically wrote 20 years ago and then

15
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,439
the situation looks slightly more clear

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,000
you have the open Society by the way the

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,399
open society and this is very much

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,558
according to also poer was based on the

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,480
idea of a democracy inhabited by a

20
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:57,000
scientists critically thinking people in

21
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,159
a very critical mode which experimenting

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,198
with the idea and not being afraid of

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,358
failing

24
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,239
and of course this type of a

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,640
confrontation between open society and

26
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,079
close Society was a formative experience

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,879
for Our Generation I do believe we're

28
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:17,719
going to a much more difficult period in

29
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:20,158
which Carl poper Met car Ro and the

30
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,239
problem of a simple theonomy between

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,759
open society and closed Society is not

32
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,280
as useful as it was so as a result of it

33
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,879
I'm very grateful to George Soros for

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,439
making this uh type of talk and I just

35
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,839
want to make three points and ask two

36
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:38,438
questions the first point is very much

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,719
about this manipulative function poer

38
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,000
himself at the end of his life became

39
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,640
obsessed with

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,239
television all his latest interviews

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,478
have been attack on television but he

42
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:53,078
never went to attack his concept because

43
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,759
it is not about television this is about

44
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:57,158
liberal rationalism how rational it

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
could be it's very much the

46
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,200
enlightenment fallacy and he basically

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,200
decided to stay with it I do believe

48
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,759
that what uh uh Mr Soros has done today

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,759
first of all is much more intellectually

50
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,840
honest being between two fallaces the

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,079
enlightenment fallacy and the postmodern

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,719
fallacy this is the problem of a moral

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,120
and tragic choice where you stand nobody

54
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,280
can simply say one is fallacy and the

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,319
other is not a fallacy but you need a

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,318
kind of a religion of your own and this

57
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:27,399
tragic nature of modern liberalism in my

58
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,598
view is something to be stressed against

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,480
a very naive type of uh things which

60
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,839
basically believe that liberalism is

61
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:40,119
natural and self- obvious and nothing to

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,158
be done the second problem is all these

63
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,719
arguments which are coming with the

64
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:47,598
postmodern fallacy are not new ones if

65
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,439
you go back to history pl's criticism of

66
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,878
democracy is very much about the rule of

67
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,318
the sophists people who are not

68
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,359
interested in truth who simply try to

69
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,560
persuade the others and honestly

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,280
speaking it's much easier to talk truth

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,519
to power than to talk truth to the

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,479
voters and from this point of view

73
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,680
rethinking electoral democracy in terms

74
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,199
of open Society I see as the major

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,599
Challenge and from this point of view

76
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:17,679
this lecture is very different from many

77
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:20,318
that we have heard uh before but if this

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,959
is the case I have three questions the

79
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,280
first has a lot to do with the problem

80
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,080
of politics and I in government

81
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,080
comparing your lecture from yesterday

82
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,159
and your lecture today yesterday you put

83
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,480
much more trust in government in

84
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,759
regulating economy now when we know how

85
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,878
much the manipulative function have

86
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,479
taken precedence in politics how sure

87
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,039
you are that the government is going to

88
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,919
fulfill the function that you subscribe

89
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:51,560
to this when it comes to the economy and

90
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,919
second is when we know now that it's not

91
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,120
only the cognitive function but this is

92
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,878
also the manipulative function are you

93
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,680
in a mood to rethink the way you have

94
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,759
been supporting education or the way you

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,000
working with media in your foundations

96
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,759
because basically part of the supremacy

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,959
of the education was also part of the

98
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,598
Enlightenment view of the world it was

99
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,280
enough to educate the people to inform

100
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,519
them the informed citizen was the ideal

101
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,518
now the citizen can be informed but he

102
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,280
can be informed in a very manipulative

103
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,079
way so in a certain way I do believe

104
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,879
that you're coming to a radical moment

105
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,478
in which we so much used to take

106
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,399
democracy and open Society for granted

107
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,519
that it takes your talk to start asking

108
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,479
questions which ass so that we have

109
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:40,918
forgotten the answers thank you very

110
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,360
[Applause]

111
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:47,680
much I W comment we can open it up you

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,120
can open it yeah so but this was I do

113
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,600
believe also there are going to be much

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,840
more important questions that are going

115
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,240
to come from the audience like yesterday

116
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,679
we're going to give the Precedence to

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,519
New York and to the Colombia University

118
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,280
students who are there so they're going

119
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,279
to have the first three questions

120
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,720
please gas I'm the senior associate Dean

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,038

132
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,038
questions the first student who I'd like

133
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,879

00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,038
here thank

136
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:54,560
you hi Mr sorus my name is San Jo I'm a

137
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,199
first year student at Columbia um

138
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,519
University School of International

139
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,759
public affairs I was born in Beijing and

140
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,399
uh um I read your theory about uh

141
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,280
reflexivity before I have a two quick

142
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:10,959
questions for you um first one is

143
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,359
um you mentioned the term the pursuit of

144
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:16,038
knowledge which I agree that it takes

145
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,240
willingness and um in my opinion

146
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:21,279
tremendous commitment but more

147
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,000
importantly I think it takes significant

148
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,559
resources too for example I need to pay

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,879
for Columbia to to listen to your

150
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,240
lecture today and um but for the

151
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,319
majority of the population people don't

152
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,478
have enough resources especially

153
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,759
economic

154
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:40,839
resources and to pursue the reality

155
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,720
that's that's why political machine has

156
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:47,359
room to man manipulate sorry so in your

157
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,360
opinion is there any solution to this

158
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,560
problem for example by devot by devoting

159
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,360
more resources perhaps more than

160
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,759
manipulative power spans to promote the

161
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,759
open Society

162
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,120
so there was a very interesting question

163
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,038
coming yeah so probably we should answer

164
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,639
question by question because she's yeah

165
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,279
she's very much interested when you

166
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,598
don't have an access to education and

167
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,719
cannot get knowledge how you can defend

168
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:19,839
yourself from the manipulative uh Power

169
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,120
of the governments and how you see the

170
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,519
solution of this yeah well o o

171
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,240
obviously

172
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:32,159
education is very education of the

173
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,439
electorate is very important in

174
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,280
developing an open society and and uh

175
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:43,839
access to education is an important

176
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:48,318
requirement uh and

177
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:52,679
basically uh many countries accept uh

178
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:55,960
most developed countries accept that

179
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,439
responsibility in in in recent years

180
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:03,399
there's been an increasing tendency to

181
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:05,038
charge fees this is in uh in in Europe

182
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,560
uh

183
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:11,199
and but only at the at the at the

184
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,839
University uh level and I think that

185
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,319
there ought to

186
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:21,239
be uh I mean you could argue that people

187
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:24,199
who get a university education get a leg

188
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,800
up in the world that it's proven that

189
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:32,038
their uh income afterwards is is uh

190
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:35,278
substantially higher than others so uh

191
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,598
uh maybe they ought to pay for that

192
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:43,519
privilege but maybe they ought to pay

193
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:47,800
for it later so uh so um in a way in

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:51,839
America uh you have universities that

195
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:54,199
give scholarships and and uh but collect

196
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:59,560
from alumni and I think that's a very

197
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:02,959
good system actually uh um so uh I'm I'm

198
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:06,039
all in favor of of of of uh making

199
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:11,278
education more widely widely available

200
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:14,679
uh but it may be appropriate for uh for

201
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,559
you know to have student loans available

202
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:20,719
that has been abused in

203
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:23,879
America uh so it is a it is a it is an

204
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,040
issue how can one provide the the the

205
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:30,159
best educational opportunities equality

206
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,360
of opportunity in education thank you

207
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,078
very much you have a second

208
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,959
question yes and um my second question

209
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:40,159
has something to do with China so when

210
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:42,518
it comes to China the culture of this

211
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,039
country emphasized Central Authority

212
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,000
since more than 2500 years

213
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,120
ago um and so far it seems to have

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,360
limited impact on its economic growth

215
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,919
and equality of foreign

216
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,959
policies so my question is in the long

217
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,039
run do you think the clash between

218
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:03,319
manipul manipulative power and public

219
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:06,838
awareness reality will influence

220
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,640
China and the structure of the world

221
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,200
it's it's a very good question about

222
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,399
China years ago it was going to be

223
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,360
question about Russia too and it was

224
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
about the political culture and to

225
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,360
certain extent where political culture

226
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,720
is going to stay in your definition of

227
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,240
the open Society because the question

228
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,160
here was where do you see the trend is

229
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,519
China is going to overcome this culture

230
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,679
of a centralized government and very

231
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,039
much much more obedient relations to

232
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,039
power yes no I mean you you you're

233
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:41,399
absolutely right that the history of of

234
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:46,120
China is an imperial history with the

235
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:49,879
ruler having a lot of power and and the

236
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,399
subjects uh being subjected

237
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:58,320
to various kinds

238
00:10:52,399 --> 00:11:01,559
of rules uh some more harsh than others

239
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,480
uh and it is to be hoped that China will

240
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:09,518
develop into a more open society as it

241
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:14,839
as it gains a power and influence in in

242
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:19,360
the in the world uh because uh I think

243
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:21,920
that there is in China a great desire

244
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,680
and need for stability it's because of

245
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,838
the history of of China people are very

246
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:32,000
concerned about maintaining

247
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:38,880
stability um and that of course relies

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,000
on the state power so China today cannot

249
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:48,679
yet be considered an open

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:51,720
Society uh but as China becomes a a an

251
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:54,679
influential great power in the world and

252
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:59,839
it needs to be accepted by the rest of

253
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:02,559
the world and and the Chinese

254
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,600
leadership will have to pay more

255
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,679
attention to what the rest of the world

256
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:14,480
thinks about China because that is the

257
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:16,479
way for China to to rise and become more

258
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,199
influential thank you very much for your

259
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,800
questions probably two more questions

260
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,799
from Colombia from New

261
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,120
York uh good morning and uh good evening

262
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,040
for you uh thank you very much for your

263
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,360
lecture it was very interesting my name

264
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:33,519
is Alexander iluk and I'm a gradate

265
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,120
student of School of International

266
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,399
Affairs here at Colombia I'm from

267
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:44,839
Ukraine and I have a question uh how uh

268
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:48,198
do you see the way a society can evolve

269
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:51,560
into avoiding manipulative mode of

270
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:53,439
government and what is the role of int

271
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,198
intellectual Elites in that process how

272
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,279
do you see

273
00:12:55,198 --> 00:13:00,879
this the question was what is the role

274
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:03,278
of the intellectual leads to prevent

275
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,720
this rise of manipulative governments

276
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,399
and this a question of somebody who

277
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
comes from Ukraine so he knows what he

278
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,559
speaks

279
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:16,518
about I I I think your question is very

280
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:19,399
very relevant because I I firmly believe

281
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,480
that an open Society does need an

282
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,679
intellectual Elite and that is not a

283
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,720
very

284
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:29,319
popular

285
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,440
um idea today uh because because

286
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,680
everything is tends towards

287
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:39,639
egalitarianism uh and I think that is

288
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:43,078
the that is actually uh uh dangerous uh

289
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:46,360
for an open Society because you have one

290
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:49,120
person one vote right but the

291
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,360
educational level the level of

292
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,360
understanding seriousness Etc of

293
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,000
different people is not not the same and

294
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,120
therefore there there needs to be

295
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,320
well-informed people people who are

296
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,720
concerned with with the with the with

297
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,720
the public interest who take more

298
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,360
interest Express their views and their

299
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,519
views gain some

300
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:19,560
respect

301
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:23,679
um in in in England uh basically

302
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:26,119
democracy developed uh under the careful

303
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,519
guide guidance and of the

304
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,440
aristocracy uh people who who held

305
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,919
themselves to pretty high

306
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,519
standards and and so on um and they had

307
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:46,000
also the Leisure to to be concerned with

308
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:51,278
public affairs um and um I think we need

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,679
more of that uh because these issues are

310
00:14:51,278 --> 00:15:01,039
not that easy to understand and and um

311
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,039
if if U now with the various

312
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:13,559
uh methods of uh of uh well of of uh

313
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:16,639
reaching the broad public um the

314
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:20,838
intellectuals the elite is more

315
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,680
concerned manipulating reducing messages

316
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:30,399
to a level where it gets a lot of

317
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:34,479
traction so uh the elite has to have a a

318
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:37,278
a commitment to The Pursuit Of Truth and

319
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,839
then it has to have influence in the in

320
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,480
the general public I think that is those

321
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,959
are the conditions that you actually

322
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,278
need for a flourishing open Society

323
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,039
thank you very much and one more

324
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,159
question from New York after that we're

325
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,278
going to come to buest and probably

326
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,278
we'll go back to New York

327
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:01,239
later oh hi I'm I'm Matthew flag I'm a

328
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,360
second year PhD student in the economics

329
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,959
Department um Mr Soros you mentioned

330
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,079
that in order for an open Society to

331
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,359
function the the cognitive function of

332
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,159
our thinking must take precedence over

333
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,759
the manipulative

334
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:17,679
function but as we've discussed those

335
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,399
who espouse the manipulative function

336
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:24,318
seem dedicated to the end of suppressing

337
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,600
the objective reality u in your view uh

338
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:28,719
beyond the role of Education as we've

339
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,159
already discussed is it an achievable

340
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,519
goal go to have the majority of people

341
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:38,559
in a society dedicated to the pursuit of

342
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:41,159
Truth and uh if so uh how can we go

343
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,958
about achieving this goal in the face of

344
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,198
opposition to the truth from the

345
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,958
manipulators do you believe perhaps that

346
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,318
the media could could play a role in

347
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,919
this and how could they go about uh

348
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:56,120
doing

349
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:59,719
this media no uh Pato is going to be I

350
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,879
do believe uh happy to listen to this

351
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,120
question because the question was do you

352
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,959
expect that they are going to be the

353
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,318
majority of the TR seekers in society

354
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,798
and if they're not going to be such a

355
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:12,199
majority Beyond education where you're

356
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:13,838
going to see the solution what what

357
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:17,439
should be the role of the media and

358
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:21,038
basically what is the role of the media

359
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,439
well let me take a very

360
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:27,679
elitist point of view and I think that

361
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:31,919
even a very small percentage of the

362
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,798
population that that is uh genuinely

363
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,200
concerned with the public interest uh

364
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:41,200
can make a big difference uh because you

365
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,640
could see that the competition between

366
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,160
the various political views usually

367
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,679
bring you very very close to

368
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:54,320
50% uh it's interesting question why

369
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,360
that is but there is a convergence

370
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:00,720
around the 50/50 split and it's a very

371
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:04,319
very narrow so uh

372
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,120
uh difference that actually wins or

373
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:12,798
loses votes so if you just

374
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:15,719
have just a few percent that is

375
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:18,759
particularly

376
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:23,240
say is concerned with the pursuit of

377
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:26,519
Truth uh it could make a a tremendous

378
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:30,880
difference now the question of of of of

379
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:33,960
media is a very very troubling question

380
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,679
because media has two functions on the

381
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,279
one hand it's an

382
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:44,519
indispensable uh uh element in an open

383
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:46,519
Society it has an Institutional role U

384
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:50,839
on the other hand it's a

385
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:52,400
business and as a business it has to

386
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:57,000
cater to the

387
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,320
demand and if there is no demand for

388
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,880
serious information

389
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:03,359
uh but for

390
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,600
entertainment

391
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:09,359
then the media that is going to be

392
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:12,000
popular and read by a lot of people or

393
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:15,839
listened to by a lot of people is not

394
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,640
going to be concerned with serious

395
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:22,439
discussion of Affairs so in the end it

396
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,280
really does come down to the

397
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,558
electorate thank you very much we're

398
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,759
going to buest but is we heard there is

399
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,759
a good news for you you don't need a

400
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:34,200
majority of Truth stickers you should

401
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:38,480
have them only in The Swinging States

402
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,440
so so uh please let's go let's go with

403
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,759
the questions uh from

404
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,759
buest please M there is a question

405
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,679
here thank you I actually covered the

406
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:54,558
2004 election as a reporter so in a

407
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,320
sense I'm on both sides of this question

408
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,639
representative of the media and I hope

409
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:02,480
some kind of Truth seek

410
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,000
uh I'm afraid though that my verdict uh

411
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,640
at least from my experience covering

412
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,319
that election is going to be a bit

413
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,038
dismaying uh with with respect to what

414
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,038
you've told us here today I was struck

415
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,400
again and again when I interviewed

416
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:18,679
people uh at rallies particularly at

417
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,080
rallies for George W bush uh and I'm

418
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,919
talking about educated people uh people

419
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,759
who read the New York Times every day

420
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,799
and so on the number of times I would be

421
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,879
told for example that weapons of mass

422
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,759
destruction were were found in Iraq uh

423
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,440
and these again were not bited people

424
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,519
they read the Press uh they were

425
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,159
perfectly able to read in the press that

426
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,960
weapons were not found but I gradually

427
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,000
came to the view that our whole model of

428
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,000
how people understand politics very

429
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,919
often is wrong we tend to think of it as

430
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,200
a kind of inductive process by which

431
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,200
people gather facts and then make a

432
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,960
judgment about a political candidate or

433
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,558
a policy according to how it conforms to

434
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,279
the truth of those facts and in fact I

435
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,759
found again and again that people would

436
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,798
begin with a belief in this case a

437
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,839
belief in George W bush and his

438
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:10,319
leadership and then they would assemble

439
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,798
the facts to Accord with that original

440
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,960
belief and when they came to a conflict

441
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,278
that was particularly strong and the

442
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,278
fact that weapons of mass destruction

443
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:23,359
having served as the uh occasion or the

444
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,960
reason for the war were then not found

445
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,439
when they came to that kind of strong

446
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,798
conflict they simply rejected it out of

447
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,200
hand uh and I saw this and heard this so

448
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,200
much and from people who were again

449
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,880
educated had critical faculties of the

450
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,558
sort that you've just described uh had

451
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,240
been to the elite schools in the United

452
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:45,079
States that it struck me very strongly

453
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,440
that um much of the way we think about

454
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:50,278
how people make decisions about politics

455
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,240
May well be wrong I'm sorry that's a

456
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:54,519
long way to get to the point of if

457
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,558
indeed my conclusion or what I

458
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,918
discovered is true what are the

459
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:02,960
implications for your view of the open

460
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:07,200
society and what's necessary to it but

461
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:10,880
actually I would be interested in your

462
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:16,360
conclusions uh from your

463
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:20,360
uh experience but I I do think that at

464
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:25,798
around that time there was

465
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:28,519
really an a an increased uh disregard

466
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:34,278
for facts in the information that people

467
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:39,679
people were getting and there was a the

468
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:45,119
propaganda machine that was uh uh

469
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:46,640
parading as legitimate media uh you know

470
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:51,199
Fox

471
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,200
television uh their motto was uh uh what

472
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,400
was it

473
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:02,558
uh fair and balanced or fair and

474
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:06,679
balanced which was an Ian statement uh

475
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:11,480
um and it did actually mislead

476
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:14,519
people um because they were getting this

477
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,558
information as if it was information and

478
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:20,038
it was

479
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:23,119
deliberate uh misstatement of facts so

480
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:26,480
and you it you had it from politicians

481
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:29,199
like like vice president Cheney who had

482
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,240
absolutely no hesitation

483
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:38,440
uh saying things uh that were actually

484
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,440
untrue so uh um coming from

485
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,320
authoritative

486
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:49,919
sources it I think it did s the public

487
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:53,000
uh now you could say that the public is

488
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,159
responsible because they put up with it

489
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,400
uh and I think they are but I think that

490
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:04,880
this was a particularly dark period

491
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:06,400
in in in uh in American public discourse

492
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I don't know whether you'd agree with

493
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,880
that but that's that certainly was was

494
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,080
my

495
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,080
impression thank you very

496
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,079
much

497
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,640
please thank you very much my question

498
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,880
is very simple do you believe that the

499
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:28,640
pursuit of Truth leads to an education

500
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,880
for truth and this leads for moral

501
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,880
values on

502
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,240
education not

503
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,880
necessarily not not not

504
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,038
necessarily

505
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,880
uh I

506
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:47,398
personally seem to have this

507
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:52,640
uh

508
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:56,599
particular Quest or or or or or U

509
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,360
emotional commitment but but I think

510
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,480
it's easy to

511
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,439
have different set of

512
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,480
values and and

513
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,000
um if you've been reasonably

514
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,319
successful

515
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:19,079
um living a myth uh that you have

516
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:21,879
created then there's nothing to stop you

517
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:26,839
from doing it so it's not that that's

518
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:30,880
exactly otherwise if if the truth

519
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,798
eventually uh uh uh had to convince you

520
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,840
then of course people would be convinced

521
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,759
that the problem wouldn't be there so

522
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:41,240
actually and

523
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:43,599
particularly since when it comes to

524
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,278
Natural phenomena we have

525
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:54,719
learned that uh you know Illusions don't

526
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:58,079
work as well as as uh as um a proper

527
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,798
understanding of the laws of nature you

528
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,839
know

529
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:04,960
starting with the

530
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:08,918
Alchemists you know who used incantation

531
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:13,480
to try to make uh uh gold out of Base

532
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:16,240
metals and you know they never

533
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,240
succeeded human Affairs are

534
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,480
different you can actually succeed

535
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,759
that's the whole point of what makes

536
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,038
what why reflexivity makes human

537
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,919
Affairs so very different

538
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,440
you know if the Alchemist if they had

539
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,200
been active in the financial markets uh

540
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,480
they would probably be

541
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,720
prospering uh because you can actually

542
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,240
change Reality by incantation so that's

543
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:49,240
how human Affairs are different from

544
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:52,798
natural Affairs and so you don't the

545
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:57,759
truth doesn't have the same convincing

546
00:26:52,798 --> 00:27:00,319
power because it can itself be modified

547
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:04,079
it can be

548
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,240
manipulated and that's really why we

549
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,199
have this

550
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,000
problem thank you very much there was

551
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,000
two questions there

552
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:21,559
please I was actually very disturbed by

553
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:24,640
this uh this idea of manipulative

554
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:29,158
function I actually lived through both

555
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:32,520
2004 and 2008 elections in the US as a

556
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:36,559
foreigner and my what what Stroke Me In

557
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:41,839
Your in your speech in your lecture was

558
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:45,879
that you did not mention um the 2008

559
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:48,599
campaign and the Obama strategy which

560
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,000
was profoundly man manipulative by your

561
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,798
definition I mean it was obviously truth

562
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,599
but it was truth well told and I think

563
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:59,918
because of the wellt element it was so

564
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:02,798
persuasive that's why Obama beat Senator

565
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,559
Clinton in the primaries and then was so

566
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:07,679
strongly positioned in the general

567
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:11,158
election if if you agree that there was

568
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,840
an element of Charisma and manipulation

569
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:17,679
and selling the truth in in in his

570
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,959
campaign then there is a real dilemma

571
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,240
because obviously to change the society

572
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,079
away from

573
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,240
manipulative State we need to gain

574
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,158
political power but to do this we need

575
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,200
to join the game of manipul ating and

576
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:35,399
then it is a a a moral problem that I

577
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,480
would like to know how to explain to my

578
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:40,479
students here no I I I would have

579
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:50,080
to I I really have to differ from you

580
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:52,720
because yeah clearly uh Obama had

581
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,519
political advisors and they were telling

582
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:00,319
him what to say and what not to say and

583
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:02,759
and so on but there was a very different

584
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:07,240
attitude that

585
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:09,558
Obama expressed and he treated C the

586
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,759
electorate as intelligent people and

587
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:17,879
talk to them as intelligent people now

588
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:20,798
he wasn't widely heard but the the tone

589
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,760
and the intention and and the standards

590
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:28,480
that he applied were really to

591
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:32,278
me actually remarkably

592
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,240
uh um different from the other

593
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:40,440
side

594
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:44,359
uh the difference was in' 08 was was as

595
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,679
great as it was in ' 04 in in now I may

596
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:50,959
be biased so I in fact I am biased

597
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,240
nevertheless I believe this to be true

598
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,200
so however of

599
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,079
course you

600
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,759
you you can't avoid taking into account

601
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,558
uh the fact

602
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,960
that people's perceptions can be

603
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:10,879
manipulated and I think if you if you

604
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,200
disregard it you have no chance of

605
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,440
getting

606
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,080
elected thank you very much before going

607
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,759
there I remember politicians from the

608
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:21,038
Communist period on this talk on

609
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:23,480
manipulation who used to say we are

610
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:26,119
saying the truth only the truth but not

611
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,509
the whole truth so from this point of

612
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:31,679
there is a question there

613
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:31,680
[Music]

614
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:40,000
hello Alexander alunan U Moscow one of

615
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:43,479
Moscow universities and now seeu uh

616
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,839
visiting researcher um let me be in kind

617
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:52,599
of uh advocate for Dil uh for deil

618
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:55,398
uh founding fathers didn't promise

619
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:59,918
person of Truth they just promised

620
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:59,918
person of happiness and

621
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,480
Freedom isn't isn't it enough or was it

622
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:16,158
wrong I mean uh

623
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:18,440
is was they understandable I mean they

624
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,320
didn't they didn't say nothing about

625
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:26,240
person of Truth they said that um every

626
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:28,798
man every man could person the happiness

627
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,278
and every man is free

628
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:34,720
so maybe it's

629
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:36,319
enough or we should just should uh

630
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,480
person the

631
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,519
truth I had problem yeah the question

632
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,120
wasn't of course it's interesting one he

633
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,399
said when you have been referring to the

634
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:47,518
founding fathers the founding fathers

635
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:49,839
said nothing about the truth they were

636
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,359
about pursuing of happiness and freedom

637
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,599
do you need truth in order to be free

638
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:58,158
and happy this is the question in a way

639
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,158
I got it here

640
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:10,038
I definitely think so um because because

641
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:11,240
of this the um uh the importance of

642
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:15,200
understanding

643
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:20,679
reality uh in order

644
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:25,798
to uh uh be able to lead a successful

645
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:29,600
life you know uh um U make an impact on

646
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:32,879
reality the way

647
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,038
uh get the results that you want as

648
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,880
opposed to

649
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:40,480
unintended adverse consequences so to

650
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,000
eliminate to reduce the adverse

651
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,319
consequences you need to understand and

652
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:52,599
you need to understand that in the case

653
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:56,480
of human Affairs reality is not a a

654
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:59,918
passive Target that you shoot at it's a

655
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,720
moving Target yet and how people

656
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:06,320
perceive it and how people act changes

657
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,079
the reality that you have to deal with

658
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:13,079
so it's the reality in human Affairs is

659
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,798
much more difficult to understand but

660
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:18,398
nevertheless you need

661
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:23,079
to understand it in order to narrow the

662
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:25,558
Divergence between your intentions and

663
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:28,359
expectations on the one hand and the

664
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:32,519
outcome on the other

665
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:35,959
that's the same in both in dealing with

666
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:38,558
nature and with Humanity but but in case

667
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,079
of human Affairs is much more difficult

668
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:44,200
because it's a moving

669
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,839
Target because reality can in fact be

670
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,120
manipulated thank you very much

671
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,119
Professor

672
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,159
[Music]

673
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,399
gbor George I I loved your lecture I

674
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,440
would like to make a a few comments

675
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:04,319
disagreeing with you but I had to make a

676
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,320
comment about uh our last uh questioner

677
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,720
the expression happiness in the

678
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,000
Declaration of

679
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,119
Independence is much closer to the

680
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,679
French philicity and really meaning

681
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,440
Public Welfare to a very large extent so

682
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:23,440
this is not individual happiness it is

683
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,559
liberty and public welfare and of course

684
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,000
Public Welfare immediately gets us back

685
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:31,039
to the pursuit of Truth and I I have

686
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,199
really no question uh that the framers

687
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:37,000
uh the founding fathers were deeply

688
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,878
Enlightenment characters per uh

689
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,039
committed to The Pursuit Of

690
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:49,078
Truth so George I I have U uh uh a com I

691
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,159
have a couple of comments one is uh

692
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,679
about

693
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:57,920
elections well I think elections have

694
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:00,000
been chural democracy is the worst form

695
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,880
of government except for all others

696
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,519
elections have been incredibly

697
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,680
problematic for whenever we have had

698
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,039
genuine elections let us say for the

699
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:11,879
last 100 years and talk about the

700
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:14,159
manipulative function here in Hungary uh

701
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,599
we just had a rather extreme example

702
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:20,000
recently uh of that in an election

703
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,680
campaign never mind of course Hitler

704
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,599
Etc

705
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:29,118
so what the electorate does in response

706
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,920
to politicians who as you said want to

707
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,400
be reelected or want to get office and

708
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:39,599
who highly manipulative in many ways is

709
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,119
um never to be quite known but I'm my my

710
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,440
own experience over the last decades has

711
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:47,480
led me to believe if elections come out

712
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,200
the right way we are very lucky it is

713
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,318
then those few percent you just

714
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:54,759
mentioned but on the whole electors are

715
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:57,880
vastly

716
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,760
overtaxed in making complex decisions

717
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,480
about what the facts are or what the

718
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:07,720
policy policies should be Health policy

719
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,880
let us say or take any such thing so

720
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:11,959
that gets me to the other side of open

721
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,519
society and where I am in complete

722
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,318
agreement with you and uh which I think

723
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:20,318
has for me become vastly more important

724
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:21,759
in a way than elections I obviously

725
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:25,960
believe we have to have elections and

726
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:29,960
I'm all for them and I vote regularly uh

727
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:33,720
but the conditions freedom of speech

728
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:36,519
freedom of Association access to Media

729
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:40,879
all of those things that can help us in

730
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:43,199
the pursuit of Truth uh are for me have

731
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,039
become over the years much more

732
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:49,598
important uh uh really uh uh than uh uh

733
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:52,318
the electoral process as such which is

734
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,960
also so confined by artificial arrang

735
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:59,679
Arrangements about majorities and what

736
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:01,159
have you so it is really the Vigor of AI

737
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,919
Civil

738
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:06,078
Society not necessarily using the term

739
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,400
the way it is fashionable these days but

740
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,960
the Vigor of a civil society that is our

741
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,760
only hope and there I think as a matter

742
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,679
of fact the United States comes out very

743
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,520
well because we still have a society

744
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:23,719
where lots and lots of people dig for

745
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:27,280
the facts pursue the truth use the

746
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:28,078
Freedom of Information Act and so on and

747
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,359
uh

748
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,720
and show the bush lies for what they

749
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:35,400
were

750
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,679
so that's it it was a

751
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,119
common I agree with you entirely on the

752
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:43,759
importance of the

753
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:49,318
institutions and and uh and in fact

754
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:52,079
elections can often be a detriment to to

755
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:54,639
uh the development of those institutions

756
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,480
in some of the countries that I have

757
00:37:54,639 --> 00:38:03,239
foundations uh uh take country like

758
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:06,679
Kazakhstan there is no way that the

759
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:09,399
ruling group is going to allow another

760
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:11,960
group to take possession of of of the

761
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,559
state when the there's so much oil there

762
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,318
and so much revenue and and so much is

763
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:22,599
at stake so so actually elections very

764
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:27,159
often just uh more or less push the

765
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:29,440
regime into repression uh when uh

766
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:32,000
without elections they might actually be

767
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,159
more relaxed I mean this is a rather

768
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,920
unorthodox view but uh I don't think

769
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:40,399
that elections do much good in those

770
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,400
countries so I entirely agree with you

771
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,760
and yet gradually you could

772
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,880
see a country like Kazakhstan exactly

773
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,160
because it does have uh uh natural

774
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,559
resources perhaps develop the

775
00:38:53,159 --> 00:39:01,118
institutions that will eventually lead

776
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:04,719
to a democratic elections even uh so uh

777
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:07,318
but on the other point that you make uh

778
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:10,399
that uh really elections don't matter

779
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:14,599
that much I think there has been a a

780
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,920
change in America in the structure of of

781
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,680
uh the political parties

782
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,358
because with the two- party

783
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,118
system

784
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:27,719
uh

785
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:31,039
the Dynamics were always for both

786
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:32,919
parties to try to capture the middle in

787
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:36,079
order to gain a

788
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,159
majority and then

789
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:43,480
about roughly 25 years ago a little

790
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:45,838
longer than that 30 what years ago uh

791
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,199
the Republican party

792
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:52,639
was basically uh came under the

793
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:58,879
influence of uh people with the Fairly

794
00:39:52,639 --> 00:40:03,000
extreme views who uh moved the country

795
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:07,920
further towards their views and did not

796
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,358
move towards a compromise position and

797
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,159
then the the Democrats tried to capture

798
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:17,960
the middle so they moved more and more

799
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:20,279
towards certain ideology I call it

800
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,800
Market fundamentalism and but that's

801
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,160
only part of it because of course in the

802
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,480
case of the Bush Administration it had

803
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:32,960
to do with military power and and Etc

804
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:36,480
and the the uh the uh uh unitary

805
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,920
presidency so the the Presidential Power

806
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,199
so at any rate instead of two parties

807
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,639
moving towards the middle you had one

808
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:49,159
party moving further and further to the

809
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,639
right whatever that may be uh and the

810
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:55,879
other party trying to capture it and the

811
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,639
whole political scene shifted very

812
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,680
radically

813
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:03,239
during our lifetime in in in America

814
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,078
thank you very much and therefore the

815
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:08,879
elections became more

816
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:10,680
important uh before you know so it was

817
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,079
one party or the other it didn't make

818
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:16,639
that much difference and they were

819
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,119
basically certain values as well as

820
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,639
institutions you mentioned the

821
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,559
importance of Institutions but I think

822
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:27,519
certain values of

823
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:30,480
uh you know public probity which may

824
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:33,358
have been hypocritical but nevertheless

825
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,760
they were the supposed values that were

826
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:38,039
guiding the people just you make a

827
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,720
commment probably elections could be a

828
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:43,318
fertile fallacy because if you see the

829
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,358
elections in places like Ukraine 2005

830
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:48,000
and others even elections that are

831
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,358
perceived as failing can mobilize public

832
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,119
energy so from this point of view I do

833
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:55,318
believe that elections really has a

834
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,960
problem of their own but unfortunately I

835
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:59,318
cannot see what is going to replace them

836
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,240
for the the moment so

837
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:05,239
please hello I'm Ellen Hume I'm an

838
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:07,799
anenberg fellow at ceu's Center on media

839
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:10,318
and communication studies you've taken

840
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,839
us on quite a journey with your lectures

841
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:16,279
so far and today in particular when you

842
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,559
were talking about the fate of our

843
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,160
political culture not just in America

844
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:24,358
but much more broadly it was a pretty

845
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:27,799
sad a pretty tragic picture of culture

846
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:29,480
today and what I'm trying to smoke out

847
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,519
is whether you're a pessimist or an

848
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,599
optimist and before you answer I want to

849
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:37,719
couch it in a little context I've just

850
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:39,400
returned from two African countries

851
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,358
where I've been trying to craft

852
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,119
arguments very similar to what your

853
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:46,759
wonderful foundations have done about

854
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,800
why governments should allow Free Press

855
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,680
and free speech and one of the arguments

856
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,318
actually I heard a little bit of in your

857
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:57,440
talk today and that was that governments

858
00:42:54,318 --> 00:43:00,159
that live by Propaganda tend to start

859
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,920
believing their own propaganda and

860
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:06,039
therefore the objective reality comes

861
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,559
and gets them in the end so is there a

862
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:11,599
hope in your mind or maybe I am too

863
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:15,359
hopeful that our culture will shift yet

864
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,880
again to a more reality-based operation

865
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,639
since there is Ultimate failure like

866
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,720
death built into to the propaganda

867
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,519
machine no I'm very hopeful that it will

868
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:30,959
actually and I don't think that it's a

869
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:34,719
one way Street of decline you know and

870
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:38,440
and the past was not as glorious as I

871
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:42,318
may have implied in my speech I think

872
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,400
there were periods of of of uh uh when

873
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:47,119
things were working very well in certain

874
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:54,318
countries and then they

875
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:59,000
declined uh I I was I've been rather

876
00:43:54,318 --> 00:44:04,000
shocked by the decline in

877
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,760
America um and that's that's genuinely I

878
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,760
I feel that and and it was a surprise to

879
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,160
me I think that the whole Bush

880
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:14,240
phenomenon was a shock to me because you

881
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,920
know I came

882
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:19,959
from

883
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:23,800
Hungary where America was looked up you

884
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:27,318
know with the there a certain idealistic

885
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:31,559
view of America as being the

886
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:35,639
of democracy and and and and so on so uh

887
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:39,319
it was it was and I think that there is

888
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:41,558
actually uh something that has gone

889
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:44,639
wrong and needs to be

890
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:48,800
corrected uh I think the the fact that

891
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,799
Obama was elected was a

892
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:57,480
tremendous change and yet I'm troubled

893
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:02,640
that the public opinion hasn't shifted

894
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:06,119
did as as much as the fact that a

895
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:10,159
totally different kind of president was

896
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:13,200
elected uh and the the political

897
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:15,440
discourse hasn't changed all that much

898
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,879
uh so there is I think

899
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,519
something uh

900
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:24,519
seriously wrong in America today but it

901
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:28,199
doesn't mean that the world is going to

902
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:30,719
H in a basket or that the past was

903
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:32,719
always wonderful thank you there is a

904
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,078
question there in Bulgaria we try to

905
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:37,799
believe that the pessimist is somebody

906
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:41,240
who believes that it cannot be worse but

907
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,240
The Optimist knows that it could

908
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:49,118
be okay I am from CU I am a doctor uh

909
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:54,480
student in law and I am also from

910
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:58,920
Kenya um my question relates to what um

911
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:02,000
you seem to be um concluding in terms of

912
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:06,880
uh uh back to the founding

913
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,480
fathers um why I I I am I'm a bit

914
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,760
troubled with that is because um much as

915
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,440
they were saying about self-evident

916
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:18,599
truths they belong to a particular class

917
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,079
uh their truths did not include the

918
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,800
Africans who are who they they still

919
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:26,599
enslaved their truth did not include for

920
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,160
for instance even women or there were it

921
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:31,599
was specific

922
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:36,399
truths um and yet that is where you kind

923
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:38,000
of fall back um and looking at American

924
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,280
society you would see you would say it's

925
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,960
an American society American society has

926
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:47,760
been kind of open but internally perhaps

927
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,440
when you look at its foreign policy

928
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,000
there is nothing open about it it is the

929
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:56,200
one that has been preaching in my

930
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,480
country for instance that uh Kenya about

931
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:01,239
U Market fundamentalism that you're

932
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,039
talking about that has caused a lot of

933
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,318
problems um here at see you I'm

934
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:09,800
grappling with the question of uh

935
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:13,558
enforcement of social economic rights so

936
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:16,200
my question to to you is um how open is

937
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:18,960
this concept to other realities that

938
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,159
perhaps um that there are so many people

939
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,838
who could be excluded from a

940
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:26,159
participation because of uh deprivations

941
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:30,039
and all that and yet Perhaps the main

942
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:32,719
talk I hear is about okay Free Press

943
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:37,199
free uh the civil and political rights

944
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:39,558
perhaps neglecting the I mean the the

945
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,439
social economic right and I understand

946
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:45,480
of course coming from the Communist

947
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:48,599
system communic realities it's perhaps

948
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:51,119
um I mean your realities also shape what

949
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:53,760
kind of uh Vision you would have so

950
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,880
that's the question how open is really

951
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,400
the open society that you think you you

952
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,160
you you you are thinking about yeah you

953
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,680
see uh I've been

954
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:09,440
stressing uh the

955
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:11,799
uh the difference between the our view

956
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:17,079
of the world and the way the world

957
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:20,000
actually is and certainly let's say uh

958
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:23,839
America had the

959
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,800
view of the world which believed in

960
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:31,880
equality uh human rights uh individual

961
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,200
freedom and so on and at the same time

962
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,079
you had

963
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:39,039
slavery at the time of the founding

964
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:43,160
fathers uh and when

965
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:46,039
you uh U talk about Market

966
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:49,239
fundamentalism I I think it is a a

967
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:53,558
totally false pretense you see this

968
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:57,039
invis the the uh the Invisible Hand of

969
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:59,720
the market that that provides

970
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:02,079
opportunity to all well behind the

971
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:04,239
Invisible Hand of the of the market

972
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:07,880
there is the visible hand of politics

973
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:11,279
and we sets the rules and and

974
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:15,760
uh while actually the International

975
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:18,960
System established uh uh at Breton Woods

976
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,440
uh and at the United Nations was on the

977
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:29,480
surface uh

978
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:34,760
uh a very uh rule of law kind of uh uh

979
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:37,440
um sort of equ equal treatment for for

980
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:41,760
each there's no question that the United

981
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,679
States which basically set the rules was

982
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:47,440
more equal than the

983
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:51,199
others and and it was not immediately

984
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,000
obvious but it's very definitely the

985
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:55,798
case

986
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,639
so I have a lot of sympathy with your

987
00:49:55,798 --> 00:49:58,639
position

988
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:05,279
please uh Colin mcin uh George I find it

989
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:07,639
interesting and perhaps it's a little

990
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,640
ironic that you today have come around

991
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:13,318
to defending uh a conception of politics

992
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:16,358
rather like Plato I mean ironic because

993
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:17,960
of your being a follower of Poa who of

994
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:19,558
course was very against Plato the reason

995
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,679
I say this is that you you're

996
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,559
emphasizing today the point that propa

997
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,519
neglected and you earli neglected the

998
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:28,839
influence of propaganda and manipulation

999
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:31,599
in in politics and in democracies today

1000
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:33,078
of course that problem was what Plato

1001
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,280
saw all along was the problem of

1002
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:36,880
democracy it was the problem of the

1003
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,519
sophists as you pointed out manipulators

1004
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,358
of opinion as a defense against that

1005
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:45,159
problem Plato advocated an intellectual

1006
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:46,679
Elite he'd be trained in certain ways

1007
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:48,039
and would be committed to the truth he

1008
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:50,078
called them the philosopher Kings of

1009
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:52,119
course and they would be protection

1010
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,920
against the sophists this has got as

1011
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,039
anathema to POA and other liberal

1012
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,680
Democrats because it seems to be give

1013
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:02,639
more political power to this Elite than

1014
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,759
to the run of the population so I wonder

1015
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,960
whether you'd like to comment on whether

1016
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,839
you think you've become unlike POA a

1017
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,838
platonist about

1018
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,760
politics basically the question was are

1019
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:16,440
you not becoming much more on the Plato

1020
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,119
side than on the poer side because it

1021
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,400
was much more Plato who have been

1022
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,599
pushing for the philosophers to run in

1023
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,000
order basically to have an elite which

1024
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:28,000
can counterbalance the manipulative

1025
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:32,358
power of the sophists

1026
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,719
yes I think uh um I mean it's well known

1027
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:38,798
that Papa was a little too hard on on

1028
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:41,919
lato to start with uh

1029
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:46,119
um but I I'm

1030
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:50,079
actually um had more trouble with

1031
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:55,039
lewu than with Plato because you know

1032
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:57,240
lewu was sort of a a a philosopher king

1033
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:01,159
uh run running the country and running

1034
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:03,039
it with a pretty harsh hand uh and and

1035
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:08,000
suppressing uh

1036
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:10,880
opposition uh and yet he guided

1037
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,679
Singapore to very

1038
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,720
successfully and I found that really

1039
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:21,399
quite distressing in a

1040
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:22,679
way that that he could be as successful

1041
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:28,519
while

1042
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:28,519
suppressing uh alternative views

1043
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:36,880
um and I

1044
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:40,200
mean even you look at China today it's

1045
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,880
not an very far from an open

1046
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:45,118
Society uh but there is a kind of a

1047
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,400
social

1048
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,720
contract uh

1049
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:53,920
where people accept the

1050
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:57,078
authority of of the rulers in order to

1051
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:01,159
have stability and pro and and economic

1052
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:04,240
progress and the rulers know that they

1053
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:07,440
have to provide stability and economic

1054
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:11,558
progress in order to be the

1055
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:14,480
rulers and actually it is working very

1056
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:19,200
well as a as

1057
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:22,280
a machine that is moving China forward

1058
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,960
whereas America which is a democracy and

1059
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,440
you have freedom of of all kinds of

1060
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,440
freedoms guaranteed

1061
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:39,279
basically half the Congress is out to

1062
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:43,798
trip up the other half and and U uh a

1063
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:49,798
tremendous amount of is lost in the in

1064
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:54,079
the adversarial uh fighting so uh I have

1065
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:57,480
to observe these things they they kind

1066
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:01,559
of don't fit into the conceptual

1067
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:04,798
framework with which I'm I'm I'm still

1068
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:08,200
operating I'm modifying the conceptual

1069
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:09,759
framework uh but I have

1070
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:12,960
to

1071
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:16,640
recognize that democracy doesn't necess

1072
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,798
is not necessarily a superior form of

1073
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,519
social

1074
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:23,519
organization it it requires something

1075
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:26,599
more than democracy for that to be the

1076
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:31,798
case and and I've identified the pursuit

1077
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:35,680
of Truth as that something more that has

1078
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:39,960
to be there but it really means a set of

1079
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:43,000
values also where people are

1080
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:46,400
sufficiently public-minded

1081
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,559
um to to be concerned with the public

1082
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:53,559
good I'll deal with that

1083
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:55,079
issue in in the in next lecture actually

1084
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:57,000
because I I think that's a very

1085
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:00,280
important addition

1086
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,159
requirement uh for an open Society to to

1087
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,160
be

1088
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:04,960
successful thank you very much there was

1089
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:09,679
a question very early on and I feel

1090
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:11,599
guilty it yeah and thank you um I would

1091
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,759
like to join on the debate about the

1092
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,640
manipulation and the politics and I

1093
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:21,480
think the key word is conscious cons

1094
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:25,279
Consciousness so um Idol voter in an

1095
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:28,760
ideal country would U listen to every

1096
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,960
political parties speak and um he he

1097
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:35,520
would said that uh yeah yes he he wanted

1098
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:41,679
to operate with my feelings he he he

1099
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:45,559
just lied or or he just um he just he's

1100
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:48,159
not the man of this country um so he he

1101
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:50,880
would decide this and he he just

1102
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:55,399
wouldn't vote on this party or on this

1103
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:57,920
man and uh my family has Sweden friends

1104
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:04,798
who said to me that it

1105
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:08,200
is it is ex it is ex existing in Sweden

1106
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:11,480
so if a party would say to the Sweden

1107
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:14,199
people that we would low the taxes if

1108
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:17,920
you would vote on us then they would

1109
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:21,399
just laugh at them and they it couldn't

1110
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,760
be a party and uh do you think that

1111
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:27,358
Americans uh don't have this type of

1112
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,720
Consciousness or is it lack of the

1113
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:32,719
American

1114
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:35,000
society the question if I'm going to

1115
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:36,919
interpret it crudely is do you believe

1116
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,199
that because the Americans are foring

1117
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,280
the taxes they don't have a moral

1118
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:44,239
feeling they don't have don't have a

1119
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,519
moral feeling Moral Moral feeling or

1120
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:48,959
moral sentiment yes I I think that there

1121
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:53,159
is a very serious problem in America now

1122
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:56,240
with values and I think uh the market

1123
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,279
fundamentalism this uh belief that the

1124
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:03,199
Pur suit of

1125
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:07,119
self-interest somehow has a moral uh um

1126
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:10,558
support in this Invisible Hand of the

1127
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:13,599
market that ensures that people pursuing

1128
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:16,319
self-interest uh get the reach the best

1129
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:20,519
allocation of resources it's a it's a

1130
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:25,400
it's a false uh interpretation of

1131
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:28,159
markets of society and and it has become

1132
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,160
extremely

1133
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,599
uh

1134
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:37,119
powerful because it happens to be very

1135
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:41,798
suit greatly beneficial to the owners

1136
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:45,760
and managers of capital it's it's a very

1137
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:49,038
satisfactory uh set of beliefs for them

1138
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:53,039
and therefore they actually were willing

1139
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:54,799
to invest very serious amounts of money

1140
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:59,480
and effort

1141
00:57:54,798 --> 00:58:02,599
to man ulate public opinion where it it

1142
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:05,358
was it has been accepted as the truth

1143
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:09,640
and and we just had the collapse of the

1144
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:12,199
financial markets which ought to uh

1145
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:13,239
bring about a serious questioning

1146
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:18,838
whether

1147
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:22,078
this set of uh this ideology

1148
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:23,798
actually is well founded or not I am of

1149
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:27,280
course very

1150
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:29,599
much a Critic of it

1151
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,079
uh I don't want to manipulate you and

1152
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,599
I'm going to tell you the truth we have

1153
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:37,280
three minutes and there's at least 78

1154
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:40,880
questions being there so on this

1155
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:43,119
truthful note I'll go to give uh uh Dean

1156
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,280
Stone the possibility to ask a question

1157
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,720
and I do believe that the other

1158
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:51,960
questions after that uh probably we can

1159
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:55,078
discuss outside of outside of the room

1160
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:58,240
there thank you uh Diane Stone from the

1161
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:01,519
Department of Public policy here at ceu

1162
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:03,759
I've been struck this afternoon how much

1163
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:06,798
the discussion about politics has been

1164
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,839
very much focused on the nation state

1165
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:11,599
talking about political parties

1166
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:14,440
elections the American political

1167
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:17,519
culture so my question would be to what

1168
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:21,400
extent is the notion of open Society

1169
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:24,400
linked to the nation state as a society

1170
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:27,920
or the degree to which open Society can

1171
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:30,760
be delin and and associated with the

1172
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,480
ways in which society is forming in new

1173
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:36,640
forms uh transnationally through the

1174
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:39,480
internet and various other kinds of um

1175
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:42,400
associations so Regional Association for

1176
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,838
for example um and the extent to which

1177
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,400
uh open Society could operate through

1178
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:51,078
things like Twitter for

1179
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:54,079
example uh and also is this a domain

1180
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:56,839
where the threats and challenges to open

1181
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,000
Society are perhaps greater than at the

1182
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:01,400
national

1183
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,639
level the very last sentence was to is

1184
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,880
this is where the challenges uh to the

1185
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:08,920
open no I think it's an excellent

1186
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:14,519
question and and and and

1187
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:18,880
clearly um the problems confronting

1188
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:24,318
Humanity trans transcend National

1189
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:27,760
borders and because of uh the uh

1190
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:31,440
globalization of financial maret markets

1191
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:34,359
Etc actually the the uh financial

1192
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:39,159
markets have become Global the economy

1193
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:43,038
of course has become Global but the the

1194
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:47,879
uh political system remains founded on

1195
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:49,920
the principle of sovereignty and that

1196
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,960
has very

1197
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:57,358
serious uh creates very serious problems

1198
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,318
and unless we solve that problem

1199
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:00,960
um

1200
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:03,759
actually

1201
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,960
the global markets will

1202
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,760
disintegrate but more than that for

1203
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:11,199
instance we are going to cook uh because

1204
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:14,280
of global warming because we will not be

1205
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:17,118
able to solve that problem it's not one

1206
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:20,519
that can be solved on a national uh

1207
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:23,599
basis so we we actually have to make

1208
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:26,798
some very important steps forward in the

1209
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:31,838
form of international

1210
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:34,880
governance to catch up with the

1211
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:37,279
globalization of of our

1212
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,200
civilization thank you very much I want

1213
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,359
to excuse myself for those who didn't

1214
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,239
manage to take the flo they're going to

1215
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:45,239
be two more lectures so you're going to

1216
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:47,558
have your opportunity thank you very

1217
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:49,159
much to our colleagues from New York

1218
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:51,559
they had the first word they didn't get

1219
01:01:49,159 --> 01:01:53,358
the last one but I do believe they're

1220
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:55,960
also going to get their chance

1221
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:58,318
and director

1222
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:01,400
well I want to thank our audiences here

1223
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:04,920
in Budapest and in New York uh I think

1224
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:08,000
through open discourse we have explored

1225
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:11,920
the challenges uh and opportunities of

1226
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:14,440
open Society tomorrow uh these ideas

1227
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,480
will be explored even further when Mr

1228
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,798
Soros looks at what he sees as a

1229
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:23,278
conflict between open society and

1230
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:27,440
economic fundamentalism so uh be

1231
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:29,880
prepared to return and engage in further

1232
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,559

1233
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,838
we've had here today for now let me
