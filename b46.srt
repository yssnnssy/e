00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:13,879
[Applause]

2
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:16,278
thank you very much and thank you for

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,960
coming and also I want to greet the

4
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:23,160
students at

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:25,960
MIT uh today I'll apply the concepts

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,960
introduced yes yesterday

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,080
fallibility reflexivity and the human

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,439
uncertainty principle

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,519
in into the financial markets please

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:41,079
brace yourselves because I'll pack a

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,559
lifetime of experience into this one

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:48,198
lecture the financial markets provide an

13
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:51,320
excellent laboratory for testing the

14
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:55,198
ideas that I put forward in an abstract

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,000
form yesterday the course of events is

16
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:01,518
easier to observe than in most other

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,959
places many of the facts take a

18
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:06,798
quantitative form and the data are well

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,679
recorded and well

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,759
preserved the opportunity for testing

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,920
occurs because my interpretation of

22
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,359
financial markets directly contradicts

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,280
the efficient market hypothesis which

24
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,478
has been the prevailing Theory uh about

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,640
financial

26
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:31,200
markets that theory claims that markets

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,200
tend towards equilibrium deviations

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,040
occur in a random fashion and can be

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:44,520
attributed to extraneous shocks if that

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,520
theory is valid mine is false and vice

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,879
versa let me State the two Cardinal

32
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,640
principles of my conceptual framework as

33
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:58,640
it applies to the financial markets

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,519
first market prices always distort the

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,960
underlying fundamental

36
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:07,560
the degree of distortions may vary from

37
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,840
the negligible to the significant this

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,080
is in direct contradiction to the

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,319
efficient market hypothesis which

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,319
maintains that market prices accurately

41
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:22,318
reflect all the available

42
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:25,639
information second instead of playing a

43
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:28,479
purely passive role in reflecting an

44
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:30,719
underlying reality financial markets

45
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,079
also have an active role

46
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,080
they can affect the so-called

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,680
fundamentals that they are supposed to

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,159
reflect there are various Pathways by

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,800
which the mispricing of financial assets

50
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:51,479
can occur the most widely traveled are

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,080
those which involve the use of Leverage

52
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:57,199
both debt and Equity

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,840
leveraging the various feedback loops

54
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,679
may give the impression that markets are

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,360
are often right but the mechanism at

56
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,959
work is very different from the one

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,720
proposed by the prevailing

58
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,360
Paradigm I claim that financial markets

59
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,799
have ways of altering the fundamentals

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,680
and that may bring about a closer

61
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,400
correspondence between market prices and

62
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,840
the underlying fundamentals contrast

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,959
that with the efficient market

64
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,319
hypothesis which claims that markets are

65
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:37,959
always accurately reflecting reality and

66
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,958
automatically tend towards

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,840
equilibrium my two propositions Focus

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,080
attention on the reflexive feedback

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,319
loops that characterize financial

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,120
markets there are two kinds of feedback

71
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:55,839
negative and positive negative feedback

72
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,519
is

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,680
self-correcting positive feedback is

74
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,079
self-reinforcing

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,879
thus negative feedback sets up a

76
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:11,920
tendency towards equilibrium while

77
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:14,280
positive feedback produces Dynamic

78
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,120
disequilibrium positive feedback loops

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,319
are more interesting because they they

80
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,639
can bring about big moves both in market

81
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:27,120
prices and in the underlying

82
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:31,519
fundamentals a positive feedback process

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,360
that runs its full course is initially

84
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,519
self-reinforcing but eventually it is

85
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,280
liable to reach a climax or reversal

86
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,680
point after which it becomes

87
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,758
self-reinforcing in the opposite

88
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,680
direction but positive feedback

89
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,840
processes don't necessarily run their

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,680
full course they may be aborted at any

91
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,679
time by negative

92
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,520
feedback I have developed a theory of

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,360
about boom bus processes or bubbles

94
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,879
along these

95
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,520
lines every bubble has two components an

96
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,038
underlying Trend that prevails in

97
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:18,359
reality and a misconception relating to

98
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:22,000
that Trend a boomas process is set in

99
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,080
motion when a trend and a misconception

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,879
positively reinforce each other the

101
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:31,038
process is liable to be tested by

102
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,719
negative feedback along on the way if

103
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:37,159
the trend is strong enough to survive

104
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,120
the test both the trend and the

105
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,680
misconception will be first further

106
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,360
reinforced eventually Market

107
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,800
expectations become so far removed from

108
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,759
reality that people are forced to

109
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,038
recognize that the misconception is

110
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:58,199
involved a Twilight period ensues during

111
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:01,439
which doubts grow and more people lose

112
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,319
Faith but the prevailing trend is

113
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,839
sustained by

114
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:09,639
inertia as Chuck Prince former head of

115
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,279
citybook group said we must continue

116
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:16,319
dancing until the Music

117
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:20,279
Stops eventually a point is reached when

118
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:23,919
the trend is reversed it then becomes

119
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:28,038
self-reinforcing in the opposite uh

120
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:31,000
Direction let me go back to the example

121
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,639
I used when I or originally proposed my

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,319
theory in

123
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,319
1987 the conglomerate boom of the late

124
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:45,240
1960s the underlying trend is

125
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:49,400
represented by earnings per share the

126
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,720
expectations relating to to that uh

127
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:57,198
Trend by stock

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:02,039
prices so here you have the the earnings

129
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,038
per share and the stock

130
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:09,639
prices conglomerates improved their

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,319
share their earnings per share by

132
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,840
acquiring other

133
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,960
companies inflated expectations allowed

134
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,038
them to improve their earnings

135
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,799
performance but

136
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,918
eventually

137
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,000
reality could not keep up with

138
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:30,038
expectations after a Twilight period the

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,399
price trend was reversed all the

140
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:36,719
problems that had been swept under the

141
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,359
carpet surfaced and earnings collapsed

142
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,639
as the president of one of the

143
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,120
conglomerates ogan corporation told me

144
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:52,240
at the time I have no audience to play

145
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:55,439
to this this is a model of um of uh the

146
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,639
conglomerate bubble the the the

147
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:03,399
charts of actual conglomerates like ogan

148
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:09,038
Corporation closely resemble uh this

149
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:12,839
chart bubbles uh uh that conform to this

150
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:15,759
pattern go through distinct

151
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:21,279
stages uh there is the

152
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,280
Inception then a period of

153
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:30,478
acceleration um reinforced by uh okay by

154
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:34,000
successful tests when the price de lines

155
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:37,718
but the it's still the trend reinforces

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,320
is strong enough to reinforce itself

157
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:47,879
then a Twilight period ensues uh um and

158
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:52,120
a reversal point or climax is reached

159
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:56,759
followed by an acceleration on the the

160
00:08:52,120 --> 00:09:00,519
downside cating in a financial

161
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:03,919
crisis the length and strength strength

162
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:07,159
of each stage is unpredictable but there

163
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:10,679
is an internal logic in the sequence of

164
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:13,120
stages so the sequence is predictable

165
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,879
but even that can be terminated by

166
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,399
government intervention or some other

167
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:22,078
form of negative feedback in the case of

168
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,000
the conglomerate boom it was the defeat

169
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:27,639
of lisco in its attempt to acquire

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,559
manufacturers Handover trust that

171
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,278
constituted the climers climax or

172
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,078
reversal

173
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,159
Point

174
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:42,199
typically bubbles have an asymmetric

175
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:45,679
shape the Boom is long and and drawn out

176
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,839
slow to start it accelerates gradually

177
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,159
until it flattens out during the

178
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,839
Twilight period the bust is short and

179
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,919
steep because it's rainforce by the

180
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,600
forced liquidation of unsound

181
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:02,519
positions disillusionment turn turns

182
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,200
into Panic reaching its climax in a

183
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,679
financial

184
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,720
crisis the simplest case is a real

185
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:16,078
estate Boom the trend that precipitates

186
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,560
it is that credit becomes cheaper and

187
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:22,838
more easily available the misconception

188
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,199
is that the value of the collateral is

189
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,320
independent of the availability of

190
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,800
credit as a matter of fact the

191
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,879
relationship between the availability of

192
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,679
credit and the value of the collateral

193
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,200
is

194
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:40,559
reflexive when credit becomes cheaper

195
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,000
and more easily available activity picks

196
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,838
up and real estate values rise there are

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,839
fewer defaults credit performance

198
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:53,200
improves and lending standards are

199
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,639
relaxed so at the height of the Boom the

200
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,759
amount of credit involved is at its

201
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,680
maximum and a reversal precipitates

202
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,439
forcely liquidation depressing real

203
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,359

204
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,440
prices yet this

205
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,839
misconception continues to ur in various

206
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,600
guises for instance the international

207
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,120
banking crisis of

208
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,839
1982 revolved around sovereign debt

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,799
where no collateral is involved the

210
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,959
credit worthiness of the S Sovereign

211
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:32,719
borrowers was measured by various debt

212
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:36,439
ratios like debt to GDP and that service

213
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,079
to exports these ratios were considered

214
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,000
objective criteria while in fact they

215
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:43,919
were

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,480
reflexive when the re recycling of Petr

217
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,278
dollars in the

218
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,278
1970s increased the flow of credit to

219
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:54,759
countries like Brazil their debt ratios

220
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:57,759
improved encouraging further inflows and

221
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,759
starting a

222
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,600
pple not all bubbles involve the

223
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,600
extension of credit some are based on

224
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,200
Equity

225
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,159
leveraging the best examples are the

226
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,040
conglomerate boom of the

227
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:16,120
1960s and the internet bubble of the

228
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:20,319
late

229
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:23,839
1990s When Alan Greenspan spoke about

230
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:28,199
irrational exuberance in

231
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:31,720
1996 it misrepresented bubbles when I

232
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:34,838
see a bubble for in are rushing to buy

233
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,639
adding fuel to the fire that's not

234
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,440
irrational and that's why we need

235
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:44,639
Regulators to counteract the market when

236
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,279
a bubble is threatening to grow too big

237
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,360
because we can't rely on Market

238
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:54,559
participants however well informed and

239
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,560
rational they

240
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:04,120
are bubbles are not the only form in

241
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:06,759
which reflectivity manifests itself the

242
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,399
they are only the most dramatic and the

243
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:12,639
most directly opposed to the efficient

244
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,639
market hypothesis therefore they deserve

245
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,959
special

246
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:20,198
attention but reflexivity can take many

247
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:23,278
other forms in currency markets for

248
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:26,039
instance the upside and downside are

249
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:30,000
symetrical so that there is no sign of

250
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:32,919
an asymmetry between boom and bust but

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,600
there is no sign of equilibrium either

252
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:38,719
freely floating exchange rates tend to

253
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,120
move in large multi-year

254
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,839
waves and the most important and most

255
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,198
interesting reflexive interaction takes

256
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:51,639
place between the financial authorities

257
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:54,359
and financial markets because markets

258
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:58,399
don't tend toward equilibrium they are

259
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,560
prone to produce periodic crisis

260
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,879
Financial crises lead to regulatory

261
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:07,958
reforms that's how Central Banking and

262
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:11,799
the regulation of financial markets have

263
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:15,319
evolved both the financial authorities

264
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:18,240
and Market participants act on the basis

265
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,680
of imperfect understanding and that

266
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,440
makes the interaction between them

267
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:28,120
reflexive and

268
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,959
unpredictable while bubbles only occur

269
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,120
intermittently

270
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:36,119
the interplay between authorities and

271
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:39,560
markets is an ongoing process

272
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:43,000
misunderstandings by either side usually

273
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:46,758
stay within reasonable bounds because

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,600
Market reactions provide useful feedback

275
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:53,639
for to the authorities allowing them to

276
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,920
correct their mistakes but occasionally

277
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,639
the mistakes prove to be self validating

278
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:03,838
send setting in motion we should or

279
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:06,278
virtuous circles such feedback loops

280
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,639
resemble bubbles in the sense that they

281
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:11,000
are initially self-reinforcing but

282
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,600
eventually uh self-defeating but

283
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,759
otherwise they take quite a different

284
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,759
shape it's important to realize that not

285
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,879
all price distortions are due to

286
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,800
reflexivity Market participants can't

287
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,078
possibly base their decisions on

288
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:33,240
knowledge they they have to anticipate

289
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,799
the future and the future is contingent

290
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,720
on the decisions that people have not

291
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:42,078
yet made what makes what those decisions

292
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,360
are going to be and what effect they

293
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:49,159
will have can't be accurately

294
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,240
anticipated nevertheless people are

295
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:54,919
forced to make decisions to guess

296
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,039
correctly people would have to know the

297
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:59,039
decisions of all of the other

298
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,639
participants and their consequence

299
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,639
quences but that's

300
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:09,039
impossible rational expectations Theory

301
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:11,838
sought to circumvent this

302
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:15,278
impossibility by postulating that there

303
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,680
is a single correct set of expectations

304
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:22,439
and people's views will converge around

305
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:26,120
it that postulate has no resemblance to

306
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:30,360
reality but it is the basis of financial

307
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:33,759
economics as it's currently taught at in

308
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,360
universities in practice participants

309
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,879
are obliged to make their decisions in

310
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,879
conditions of

311
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:44,439
uncertainty their decisions are bound to

312
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:48,600
be tentative and biased that's the

313
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,240
general generic cause of price

314
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,000
distortions occasionally the price

315
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,000
distortions set in motion a boomas

316
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,559
process more often they are corrected by

317
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,199
negative feedack back in these cases

318
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:08,000
Market fluctuations have a random

319
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,880
character I compare them to the waves

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,959
sloshing around in a swimming pool as

321
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,439
opposed to a tidal wave obviously the L

322
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,640
the latter are more significant but the

323
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,519
former are more

324
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,679
ubiquitous the two kinds of price

325
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:28,879
distortions intermingle so that in

326
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,080
reality boomas processes rarely follow

327
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,799
follow the exact course of my model

328
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:38,480
bubbles that follow the pattern I

329
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:43,480
described in my model occur only in

330
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:47,200
those rare occasions when they are so

331
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:51,919
powerful that they overshadow all the

332
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,919
other processes going on at the same

333
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,600
time it will be useful to distinguish

334
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,839
between near

335
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:05,359
equilibrium uh and far from equilibrium

336
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,879
conditions the near equilibrium

337
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:10,199
conditions are characterized by random

338
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,840
fluctuations and the far from

339
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:18,360
equilibrium situations

340
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:21,279
uh uh are those in which a bubble uh

341
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:24,959
predominates near equilibrium is

342
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:27,839
characterized by hrum everyday events

343
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,079
which are repetitive and lend themselves

344
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,599
to statistic

345
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,158
generalizations far from equilibrium

346
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:38,439
conditions give rise to Unique

347
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:41,000
historical events where outcomes are

348
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,679
generally uncertain but have the

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,319
capacity to disrupt the statistical

350
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:52,919
gener generalizations based on everyday

351
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:56,639
events the rules that can guide

352
00:18:52,919 --> 00:19:00,159
decisions in near equilibrium conditions

353
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,520
don't apply in far from equ ium

354
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:06,400
situations the recent financial crisis

355
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,639
is a case in point all the risk

356
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,159
management tools and synthetic Financial

357
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,679
products that were based on the

358
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:18,400
assumption that price

359
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:21,759
deviations from a put putative

360
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,480
equilibrium occur in a random fashion

361
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:28,158
broke down and people who relied on

362
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,200
mathematical models which had served

363
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:34,600
them well in near equilibrium conditions

364
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,600
got badly

365
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:42,240
hurt I have gained some new insights

366
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,558
into far from equilibrium conditions

367
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,720
during the recent financial

368
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:51,480
crisis as a participant I had to act

369
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,558
under immense time pressure and I

370
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,839
couldn't gather all the information that

371
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,720
would have been

372
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:01,959
available and the same applied to the

373
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,960
regulatory authorities in charge that's

374
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,319
how far from equilibrium situations can

375
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,880
spin out of

376
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,759
control and this is not confined to

377
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,360
financial markets I experienced it for

378
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,759
instance during the collapse of the

379
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:20,599
Soviet Union the fact that the

380
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,640
participants thinking is time bound

381
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:28,918
instead of Timeless is left out of

382
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:32,200
account by rational expectations Theory

383
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:35,520
I was aware of the uncertainty

384
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:39,798
associated with reflexivity but even I

385
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:44,759
was taken in by I was taken by surprise

386
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:47,599
by the extent of the uncertainty in 2008

387
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,440
it cost me dearly I got the general

388
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,359
direction of the markets right but I

389
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,200
didn't allow for the

390
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:58,719
volatility as a consequence I took on

391
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,159
positions that were too big to withstand

392
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,079
the swings caused by volatility and

393
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,640
several times I was forced to reduce my

394
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,720
positions at the wrong time in order to

395
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,759
limit my risk I would have done much

396
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,480
better if I had taken smaller positions

397
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:20,558
and stuck with them I learned a hard way

398
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,679
that the range of uncertainty is also

399
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:26,678
uncertain and at times it can become

400
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,679
practically

401
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,278
infinite uncertainty

402
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,719
finds expression in

403
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:38,599
volatility increased volatility requires

404
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:43,200
a reduction in RIS risk exposure this

405
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:44,519
leads to what canes called increased

406
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,840
liquidity

407
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:50,960
preference this is an additional factor

408
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:54,399
in the forc liquidation of positions

409
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,200
that characterize financial

410
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:02,038
crisis when the crisis abates and the

411
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,679
rain of uncertainty is reduced it leads

412
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:07,440
to an almost automatic Rebound in the

413
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,559
stock market as the liquidity preference

414
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,480
stops rising and eventually

415
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:17,038
Falls that's another lesson uh that I

416
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,278
have learned

417
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,879
recently I also need to point out that

418
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:25,159
the distinction between near and

419
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,760
equilibrium and near and far from

420
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:32,159
equilibrium conditions uh uh that uh uh

421
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:35,119
that I've mentioned was introduced by me

422
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,640
while trying to make some sense out of a

423
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:41,359
confusing reality and it doesn't

424
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,880
accurately reflect reality reality is

425
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:47,879
always more complicated than the

426
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:53,159
dichotomies we introduce into it the

427
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:56,919
recent crisis is comparable to a 100e

428
00:22:53,159 --> 00:23:00,480
storm we have had a number of Crisis

429
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:05,320
leading up to it these are comparable to

430
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:08,079
five or 10e storms Regulators who had

431
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:11,839
successfully dealt with the smaller sto

432
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:16,720
storms were less successful when they

433
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,720
applied the same methods to the 100-year

434
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,319
storms these General remarks prepare the

435
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:29,000
ground for a specific

436
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:32,960
hypothesis uh I put forward or have put

437
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,798
forward to explain the recent financial

438
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,400
crisis it's not derived from my theory

439
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:43,240
of bubbles by deductive logic

440
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,600
nevertheless the two of them stand or

441
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:52,159
fall together so here it

442
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:57,519
goes I contend that the puncturing of

443
00:23:52,159 --> 00:24:01,559
the subprime bubble in 2007 set off the

444
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:05,440
explosion of a Super Bubble much as an

445
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:08,399
ordinary bomb sets off a nuclear

446
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,919
explosion the housing bubble in the

447
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,640
United States was the most common kind

448
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:19,038
it distinguished only by the widespread

449
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,440
use of collateralized debt obligations

450
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:25,000
and other synthetic instruments behind

451
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,919
this ordinary bubble there was a much

452
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,480
larger Super Bubble growing over a

453
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,240
longer period of time which was much

454
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,440
more

455
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,759
peculiar the prevailing Trend in this

456
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,600
Super Bubble was the ever increasing use

457
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:46,359
of credit and leverage the prevailing

458
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,398
misconception was the belief that

459
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,719
financial markets are

460
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:53,839
self-correcting and should be left to

461
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,399
their own devices President Reagan

462
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:59,119
called it the magic of the marketplace

463
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:02,278
and I call it Market fundament

464
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,199
mentalism it became the dominant Creed

465
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,200
in the

466
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,159
1980s when Ronald Reagan was President

467
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,960
of the United States and Margaret thater

468
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:16,880
was prime minister of the United

469
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,519
Kingdom what made the Super Bubble so

470
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,880
peculiar was the role that financial

471
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:27,839
crisis played in making it grow since

472
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,640
the belief that markets could be safe to

473
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:34,798
left to their own devices was false the

474
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,080
Super Bubble gave rise to a series of

475
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,558
financial

476
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:42,359
crisis the first and most serious was

477
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:45,079
the international banking crisis of

478
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,918
1982 this was followed by many other

479
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:52,599
crises the most notable being the

480
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:56,038
portfolio Insurance debacle in October

481
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:59,000
1987 the Savings and Loan crisis that

482
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:01,919
unfolded in various episodes

483
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,440
between 1989 and

484
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:10,399
1994 the Emerging Market crisis of 1997

485
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,000
98 and the bursting of the internet

486
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:15,639
bubble in

487
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,079
2000 each time a financial crisis

488
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:22,679
occurred the author the authorities

489
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:25,720
intervened merged away or otherwise took

490
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:29,278
care of the Fall failing financial

491
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,960
institutions and applied mon and fiscal

492
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:36,759
stimulus to protect the

493
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,558
economy these measures reinforced the

494
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:42,759
prevailing trend of ever increasing

495
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:45,678
credit and leverage but as long as they

496
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:48,240
worked they also reinforced the

497
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,519
prevailing misconception that markets

498
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,679
can be safely left to their own

499
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,480
devices that was a

500
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,679
misconception because it was the

501
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,558
intervention of the authorities that

502
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,200
saved the system nevertheless these

503
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:08,000
crisis served as successful tests of a

504
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,679
false belief and as such they inflated

505
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,319
the Super Bubble even

506
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,480
further eventually the credit expansion

507
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:19,158
became

508
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:22,200
unsustainable and the Super Bubble

509
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,240
exploded the collapse of the subprime

510
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,679
mortgage market led to the collapse of

511
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,038
one market after another in quick

512
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,480
succession

513
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,519
because they were all

514
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,640
interconnected the firewalls having been

515
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,119
removed by

516
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,320
deregulation that's what distinguished

517
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:44,479
this financial crisis from all those

518
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:47,639
that preceded it those were successful

519
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,240
tests that reinforced the process the

520
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,799
subam crises of 2007 constituted the

521
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,319
Turning

522
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:59,359
Point the collapse then reached this

523
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:02,359
climax with the bank csy of Leman

524
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:06,798
Brothers which precipitated the large

525
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:06,798
scale intervention of the financial

526
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,600
authorities it's characteristic of my

527
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,840
boom buas model that it can't predict in

528
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:18,079
advance whether a test will be

529
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:22,278
successful or not this holds for

530
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:25,639
ordinary Bubbles as well as the Super

531
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:30,278
Bubble I personally thought that the

532
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:32,880
Emerging Market crisis of 1996 7 98

533
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:36,079
would constitute the turning point for

534
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,640
the Super Bubble but I was wrong the

535
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:42,278
authorities managed to save the system

536
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,519
and the Super Bubble continued

537
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:50,480
growing that made the bust that

538
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:53,440
eventually came in 2008 all the more

539
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,599
devastating after the bankruptcy of lean

540
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,240
Brothers on September 15

541
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:04,240
2008 the the financial markets had to be

542
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,839
put on artificial life support this was

543
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,880
a shock not only for the financial

544
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:13,158
sector but also for the real economy

545
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,679
international trade was particularly

546
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:20,039
badly hit but the artificial life

547
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:23,880
support worked and financial markets

548
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:27,038
stabilized the economy gradually revived

549
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,880
a year later the whole episode feels

550
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,200
like a bad dream

551
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,120
and people would like to forget it there

552
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:38,519
is a widespread desire to treat the

553
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:42,479
crisis as just another crisis and return

554
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:46,079
to business as usual but reality is

555
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:51,000
unlikely to oblige the system is

556
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,000
actually broken and needs to be

557
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:59,879
fixed my analysis offers some worthwhile

558
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,678
Clues to the kind of regulatory reform

559
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,519
that's

560
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:07,720
needed first and foremost since markets

561
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:10,359
are Bubble prone the financial

562
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,759
authorities have to accept

563
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:16,678
responsibility for preventing bubbles

564
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:20,038
from growing too big Alan Greenspan and

565
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,278
others have expressly refused to accept

566
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:24,000
that

567
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:27,480
responsibility if markets can't

568
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,720
recognize bubbles Greenspan asserted

569
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,839
neither can and

570
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:36,038
regulators and he was right nevertheless

571
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:39,000
the financial authorities have to accept

572
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:41,278
the assignment knowing full well that

573
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,359
they will not be able to meet it without

574
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,519
making

575
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:48,240
mistakes they will however have the

576
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,679
benefit of receiving feedback from the

577
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,759
markets which will tell them whether

578
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:56,360
they have done too much or too little

579
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,960
they can then correct their

580
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:02,199
mistakes second

581
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,038
in order to control asset bubbles it's

582
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,000
not enough to control the money supply

583
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:12,919
you must also control the availability

584
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,480
of credit this can be done by using only

585
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:21,799
monetary tools you must also use credit

586
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:25,200
controls the best known tools are margin

587
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:28,278
requirements and minimum Capital

588
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,440
requirements currently they are fixed

589
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:34,638
irrespective of the market mood because

590
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,679
markets are not supposed to have moods

591
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:41,678
yet they do and the financial

592
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:44,519
authorities need to vary margin and

593
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,120
minimum Capital requirements in order to

594
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,359
control asset

595
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:53,918
bubbles Regulators may also have to

596
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:58,079
invent new tools or revive ones that

597
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:02,120
have fallen into disuse for instance in

598
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:04,079
my early days in finance many years ago

599
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:06,398
central banks used to instruct

600
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,398
commercial Banks to limit their lending

601
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:12,678
to a particular sector of the economy

602
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:15,879
such as real estate or Consumer loans

603
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:17,840
because they felt that the sector was

604
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,600
overheating Market

605
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:23,398
fundamentalists consider that crash

606
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:26,599
interference with the market mechanism

607
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:30,199
but they are wrong now central banks

608
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:33,678
used to do it we had no financial crisis

609
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,159
to speak of the Chinese authorities do

610
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,320
it today and they have much better

611
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:43,639
control over the banking system than we

612
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:46,278
do the deposits that commercial banks

613
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:50,599
have to maintain at the Central Bank

614
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:54,240
were increased 17 times in China during

615
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:56,839
the boom and when the authorities revers

616
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,519
course the banks obeyed them with

617
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:02,879
electricity

618
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,200
or consider the internet boom Alan

619
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,600
Greenspan recognized it quite early when

620
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:13,360
he spoke about irrational exuberance in

621
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:17,119
1996 but apart from his famous speech he

622
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:19,439
did nothing to avert it he felt that

623
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,079
reducing the money supply would have

624
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,720
been too blunt an instrument to use and

625
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:29,158
he was right but he could have asked the

626
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:32,240
SEC to put a freeze on new share issues

627
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:36,039
because the internet boom was fueled by

628
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,278
Equity leveraging he didn't because that

629
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:41,000
would have violated his Market

630
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:43,038
fundamentalist

631
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,200
principles

632
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:50,558
third since markets are potentially

633
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,159
unstable there are systemic risks in

634
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:55,119
addition to the risks affecting

635
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,320
individual Market

636
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:01,398
participants participants May ignore

637
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,200
these systemic risks in the belief that

638
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:06,759
they can always dispose of their

639
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,720
positions to someone else but Regulators

640
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:13,079
can't ignore them because if too many

641
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:16,039
participants are on the same side the

642
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:17,399
positions can't be liquidated without

643
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:22,239
creating a

644
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:26,319
discontinuity or a collap or a a

645
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,799
collapse um they have to monitor the

646
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,519
positions of the particip partipants in

647
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,599
order to detect potential

648
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:37,440
imbalances that means that the positions

649
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,919
of all major Mar participants including

650
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,918
hedge funds uh and Sovereign wealth

651
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,799
funds need to be

652
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:47,199
monitored uh certain derivatives like

653
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,960
credit default swaps and knockout

654
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,000
options are particularly prone to create

655
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,559
hidden

656
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,199
imbalances therefore they must be

657
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,239
regulated and if appropriate restrict Ed

658
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:02,118
or

659
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:04,838
forbidden the issuing of synthetic

660
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:08,119
Securities needs to be subject to

661
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:10,159
regulatory approval just as ordinary

662
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,760
Securities

663
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:15,279
are

664
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:20,680
fourth we must recognize that financial

665
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,200
markets evolve in a on directional

666
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:25,480
nonreversible

667
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,719
manner the financial authorities in

668
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,880
carrying out their duty of preventing

669
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:33,358
the system from collapsing have extended

670
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,880
an implicit guarantee to all

671
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:40,759
institutions that are too big to fail

672
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,039
now they can't withdraw that guarantee

673
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,520
as long as there are institutions that

674
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,679
are too big to fail therefore they must

675
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,318
impose

676
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,480
regulations that will ensure that the

677
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:56,000
guarantee will not be

678
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,240
invoked too big to fail Banks must use

679
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,559
less leverage and accept various

680
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:05,039
restrictions on how they invest the

681
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:08,159
depositor's money deposits should not be

682
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:11,159
used to finance proprietary

683
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:13,838
trading but Regulators have to go even

684
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,759
further they must regulate the

685
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:20,759
compensation packages of proprietary

686
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:24,119
traders to ensure that risks and rewards

687
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,040
are properly aligned this may push

688
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,200
proprietary Traders out of banks into

689
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,318
hedge funds

690
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:33,519
where they properly

691
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:35,759
belong just as oil tankers are

692
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:38,519
compartmentalized in order to keep them

693
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,200
stable there ought to be firewalls

694
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:45,280
between different markets it's probably

695
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:48,000
impractical to uh separate Investment

696
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,880
Banking from Commercial Banking as the

697
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,280
glass SLE Act of 1933 did but there have

698
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,400
to be internal compartments keeping

699
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,519
proprietary trade in various markets

700
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,559
separate from each others each other in

701
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:08,000
order to prevent

702
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:11,519
contagion some banks that have come to

703
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,880
occupy Quine monopolistic positions may

704
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:19,679
have to be broken up finally the Basel

705
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,480
Accords made a mistake when they gave

706
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:26,598
Securities held by Banks substantially

707
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:29,880
lower risk ratings than regular loans

708
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:32,559
they ignored the systemic risks attached

709
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,599
to concentrated positions in

710
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:38,358
Securities this was an important factor

711
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,280
aggravating the crisis it has to be

712
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:45,838
corrected by raising the risk ratings of

713
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:48,920
Securities held by Banks and that will

714
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:51,400
probably discourage the securitization

715
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,400
of of

716
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:59,039
loans all these measures will reduce the

717
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,640
profitability and average of

718
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,960
banks this raises an interesting

719
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:07,159
question as to

720
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:10,519
timing this is not the right time to

721
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:13,920
enact permanent reforms the financial

722
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:16,199
system and the economy are very far from

723
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,480
equilibrium and they can't be brought

724
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:22,919
back to near equilibrium conditions by a

725
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,119
straightforward corrective move just as

726
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,639
when a car is kidding you must first

727
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:35,200
turn the wheel in the direction of the

728
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:39,400
skid before you uh correct the car what

729
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:43,838
makes what needs to be done in the short

730
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:47,920
term was exactly the opposite of what is

731
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:51,599
needed in the long term first the credit

732
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,318
that evaporated had to be replaced by

733
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,800
using the only source of credit that

734
00:38:54,318 --> 00:39:00,800
remained credible namely the state and

735
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:04,560
that meant increasing the national debt

736
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,640
and extending the monetary base as the

737
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:10,960
economy stabilizes you must then shrink

738
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:13,519
the monetary base as fast as credit

739
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,800
revises otherwise

740
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:20,639
deflation will will be replaced by the

741
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,359
Spectre of inflation we are still in the

742
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:27,118
first phase of this delicate

743
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:29,759
maneuver the banks are in the process of

744
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,838
ear earning their way out of a hole to

745
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,920
reduce their profitability now would be

746
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:37,400
directly

747
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,639
counterproductive regulat reform has to

748
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,200
await the second phase when the money

749
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,679
supply needs to be brought under control

750
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:50,199
and it needs to be carefully faced in so

751
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:54,639
as not to disrupt the recovery but we

752
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:54,639
can't afford to forget about

753
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:03,039
it uh you you have seen that my

754
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,640
interpretation of financial markets uh

755
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:08,639
call it the theory of reflexivity is

756
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:11,598
very different from the efficient market

757
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:15,838
hypothesis strictly speaking neither

758
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,720
theory is falsifiable by Poppa's

759
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,719
standards I predicted the bursting of

760
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:25,879
the Super Bubble in

761
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:28,519
1998 I was wrong then so am I right now

762
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,880
and some proponents of the efficient

763
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:35,838
market hypothesis are still defending it

764
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,480
in the face of all the evidence still

765
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:42,078
there is a widespread feeling that we

766
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,358
need a new paradigm and I contend that

767
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,640
my theory provides a better explanation

768
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,759
than the available

769
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:53,679
Alternatives behavioral economics which

770
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,240
is gaining increased recognition deals

771
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,799
with only one half of

772
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:03,000
reflexivity the misinterpretations of

773
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:08,280
reality but doesn't study the pathways

774
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:11,719
by which mispricing can change uh the

775
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:14,000
fundamentals I realize that my theory of

776
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:17,358
financial markets is still very

777
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,800
rudimentary and needs a lot more

778
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:26,078
development the the pathways by which uh

779
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:29,720
the the U Mis mispricing can affect the

780
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:33,760
fundamentals uh need a lot more study

781
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:36,799
obviously I can't do it on my own so I

782
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,119
may have been premature in putting

783
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,000
forward my theory as the new paradigm

784
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,720
but the efficient market hypothesis has

785
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,358
certainly proved

786
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:51,879
inadequate that has been the entire

787
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:54,799
edifice of global financial markets that

788
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,800
has been erected on the false premise

789
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,800
that markets can be left to their own

790
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,280
devices

791
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:05,720
has to be rebuilt from the ground

792
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,880
up and that concludes my today's lecture

793
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:10,519
but I would like to also want to use

794
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:14,119
this occasion to make an

795
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:17,559
announcement I have decided to sponsor

796
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:21,680
an Institute for New Economic thinking

797
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:25,400
IET for short it will be a major

798
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:27,838
institution fostering research workshops

799
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,680
and curricula that will develop an

800
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:35,318
alternative to the prevailing Paradigm I

801
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:38,719
have committed $50 million over 10 years

802
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:43,358
and I hope other others will

803
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:45,598
join I also hope that reflexivity will

804
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:48,679
one of will be one of the concepts that

805
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,960
will be explored but clearly it should

806
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:55,799
not be the only one I recognize the

807
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,199
potential conflict between being a

808
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,440
protagonist and a financial sponsor at

809
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:05,639
the same time to protect against it I

810
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:09,000
want to erect a Chinese wall between me

811
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:11,960
and The Institute to this end I will

812
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,880
extend my financial support through the

813
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:18,440
central European University and I will

814
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:22,119
not personally participate in inet the

815
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:25,200
jury will be expressly instructed to

816
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:27,838
encourage other Alternatives behind

817
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:32,279
besides the theory of ref

818
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:34,639
flexibity the plan is to launch inet at

819
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,319
a workshop on the lessons of the

820
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:42,159
financial crisis at Kings College

821
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:45,759
Cambridge on April 10th and 11th and I

822
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:49,399
hope that the new economic thinking will

823
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:54,079
find a home here at the

824
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,079
ceu thank you very much
