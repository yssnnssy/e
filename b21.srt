1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,620
well

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,620
the short talk is this

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,660
I did a lot of math

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,660
I made a lot of money

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,198
and I gave almost all of it away

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,560
that's the story of my life now

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:27,000
it's a good story but it's short

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,618
but for reasons which I won't go into

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,839
I uh

10
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:34,799
I needed money

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:38,238
and I had borrowed money to invest in a

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:42,599
company with a friends of mine

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:45,179
and I need needed to pay it back

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,460
but there was a place in Princeton

15
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,679
called The Institute for defense

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,679
analyzes

17
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,399
which was a highly

18
00:00:51,679 --> 00:01:00,000
classified place

19
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,160
under the Aegis of the government the

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,019
defense department

21
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:08,340
and what we're supposed to do

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,580
is uh break Russian codes

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,320
well that was an interesting challenge

24
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,959
uh

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,339
I like the work

26
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,959
they told us you could do your own

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,540
mathematics up to half your time which

28
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,179
the other half you had to do you know

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,080
this cold cracking business

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,080
at a certain point

31
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,280
I came to

32
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,078
Stony Brook University I was 30 years

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,900
old

34
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,478
to be the chair

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,359
of their math department

36
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,459
which was not a very strong Department

37
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,118
and I was pretty young to be the

38
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:53,039
chairman but I thought it would be fun

39
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,920
and I had a lot of money to work with

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,659
because

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,820
the governor at the time was a guy named

42
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,460
Rockefeller now I think everyone has

43
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,758
probably heard of the name Rockefeller

44
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,559
but if has anyone not heard of the name

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,038
Rockefeller

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,239
okay most of you have heard of

47
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,759
Rockefeller Rockefeller loved the State

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,159
University and was pouring money on it

49
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,019
so I had a lot of money to work with

50
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,079
and uh

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,080
hired some terrific people so

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,580
hire some terrific people

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,920
but at the same time in that time frame

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,360
I started again interested in another

55
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,359
area of math

56
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,399
and uh

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,459
I worked on that area

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,140
and came up with something really quite

59
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,378
beautiful

60
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:52,018
three dimensions it was a function I

61
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:55,139
can't really describe it but it

62
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,439
it lived in three dimensions closed

63
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:00,958
three-dimensional spaces

64
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,959
and I

65
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,659
was quite pleased

66
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,500
I showed it to churn

67
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:12,959
I I say I showed it I we I centered by

68
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,699
the mail because in those days there was

69
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,939
no email

70
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,318
and chern said well you've done this in

71
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:23,280
three dimensions

72
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:26,579
but it should work in all dimensions

73
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,439
I was very dubious but I said okay let's

74
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,120
work together and see

75
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,878
and he was right

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,640
it would work in all dimensions

77
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,878
and I was very pleased we published the

78
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,878
paper

79
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,319
and about five years later

80
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:46,018
a physicist

81
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:48,899
named Whitton

82
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,959
saw this paper and thought and he was

83
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,019
right it could apply to physics

84
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,519
and then some other physicists saw how

85
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,519
it could apply to physics

86
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:05,339
I didn't know any physics at all

87
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,780
churn might have known something but it

88
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,280
never occurred to him that would apply

89
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,000
to physics

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,158
and remarkably so you never know where

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,798
something will go

92
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:21,000
you think you're doing math and you're

93
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,758
actually doing physics maybe or whatever

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,918
so today

95
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,300
that is

96
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:34,740
called churn Simon's Theory

97
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,139
it's all over the place in physics on

98
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,439
average every day

99
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:45,060
four papers in physics

100
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:48,680
reference this churn Simon's Theory

101
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,259
so I can't take any credit for it at all

102
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,079
but uh but there it was and of course

103
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,900
I'm quite pleased about it but I can't

104
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,240
say that oh I I invented this for

105
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,819
physics

106
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,860
well

107
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:07,439
shortly after that

108
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,020
I started to get interested

109
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,478
in the world of Investments

110
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:15,000
I had come into to

111
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,819
a very small amount of money but it was

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,639
enough to start investing

113
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:24,538
and one thing led to another

114
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,439
I started hiring people

115
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:30,439
and we made what was called a hedge fund

116
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,719
and it was

117
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:37,439
remarkably successful

118
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,539
it's still going I'm not with it anymore

119
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,819
but I made

120
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:46,560
a tremendous amount of money

121
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:50,639
from this from this hedge fund

122
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,918
now my lovely wife Marilyn

123
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,740
said let's give some of it away

124
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,120
so I said okay fine so we gave some

125
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,918
charity

126
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,899
and then she said well why don't we

127
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,399
start a foundation

128
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,500
and uh

129
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,839
okay starting Foundation

130
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,478
she started a foundation

131
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,159
I put money into it

132
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:12,959
the good thing about putting money into

133
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,199
a foundation is you can give the money

134
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,659
away you've got the tax advantage but it

135
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,100
doesn't have to be spent immediately so

136
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,600
you can put money into the foundation

137
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,000
and say well we'll see what we want to

138
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,199
do with it tomorrow or next year or

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,620
whatever

140
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,900
but it grew and grew

141
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,019
and grew

142
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:36,719
so uh

143
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,459
it today

144
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,600
oh well

145
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:46,620
we decided to focus on science

146
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,900
with our uh Foundation

147
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,220
focus on science

148
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,198
uh

149
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,620
90 percent of it

150
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,620
should be science eight 60 of that

151
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,680
should be basic science

152
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,000
and 30 of that could be translational

153
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,120
science

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,699
and 10 could be education and Outreach

155
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,220
and things like that

156
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:14,879
so today uh

157
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,460
that Foundation is

158
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:22,079
extremely large

159
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:24,239
and so most of the money that I made was

160
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:29,279
put into the foundation

161
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,340
so I'm not so rich as I was before but

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,379
uh Rich enough it was extremely

163
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:37,560
interesting to model things and see them

164
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:39,180
uh programmed up God knows not by me but

165
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,879
someone else could program them up and

166
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,800
test out theories of models would it

167
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,719
work what it would not work and at the

168
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,319
same time mathematics was going

169
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,900
extremely well and I did do the work

170
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,479
there that subsequently got this

171
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:58,258
bubbling prize solved the you know kind

172
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,538
of a major problem in geometry and uh

173
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,759
was going swimmingly I was it was a it

174
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:05,159
was a great experience I was there

175
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,840
but then this was the time of the

176
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,720
Vietnam War

177
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,598
and uh the president of this

178
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,220
organization two two steps up from my

179
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,680
local boss

180
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,660
guy named Maxwell Taylor some of the

181
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,120
people with gray hair in the room might

182
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,639
remember General Maxwell Taylor anyway

183
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,620
he ran this outfit and he wrote a crazy

184
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,079
article which was well I thought it was

185
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,399
crazy in the New York Times magazine

186
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,439
section

187
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,598
uh saying how we were going to win the

188
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,940
Vietnam War and it was just you know

189
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,940
victory was days away or whatever it was

190
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,219
that he was touting and uh

191
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,659
I didn't

192
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,919
agree with that now the work we were

193
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:45,778
doing had nothing to do with the Vietnam

194
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,899
War but it annoyed me

195
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:51,000
that my head of my organization could

196
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,500
take such a silly point of view and I

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,419
wrote a nice letter to the New York

198
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,419
Times expressing that view

199
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,939
which they kindly published

200
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:08,759
in that same Sunday edition

201
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:10,679
several weeks later so now I was on the

202
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,080
watch list I didn't know it but I was on

203
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,419
the watch list for the for this place

204
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,100
and then a guy came along a few months

205
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,439
later three or four

206
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,560
and he was a he announced that he was a

207
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,899
reporter for news Week Magazine

208
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,278
and he was doing an article on people

209
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,919
who worked for the defense department

210
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,720
but were opposed to the war and he was

211
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,879
having a hard time finding anyone to

212
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,500
interview but he heard about me he read

213
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,278
my letter could he interview me and I

214
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,480
said sure what did I know of course

215
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:42,659
of course

216
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,300
you can see how sophisticated I was at

217
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:47,759
that time so he said well uh you know

218
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,319
what what do you do well I blathered on

219
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,240
about this and that but I said but my

220
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,600
algorithm has been

221
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,120
uh since they say you can do 50 of your

222
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,879
work on mathematics and the other 50 on

223
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,860
their work uh right now I'm doing only

224
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,080
mathematics and I'm keeping careful

225
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,800
records when the war is over then I'll

226
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,860
do an equal amount of their work

227
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,458
and uh that's my Approach

228
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,459
so

229
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,090
no I mean you know

230
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,500
it's not unreasonable

231
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,980
[Laughter]

232
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,778
so I went back to tell my local boss I

233
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,639
it was the first intelligent thing that

234
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:29,338
had occurred to me a little late perhaps

235
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,399
but that I decided I better tell my my

236
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,140
local boss that I gave this interview

237
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,539
and he said you did and what did you say

238
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:40,080
and I said well I said what I said he

239
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:42,599
said hmm he said I better call Taylor

240
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,000
okay pick up the phone call this General

241
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,379
Maxwell Taylor that was

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,320
a little

243
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:52,078
silence at the other end and so on and

244
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,000
and he couldn't hear what Taylor was

245
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,578
saying and then he hung up he looked at

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
me said you're fired

247
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:02,819
fired I mean I'm fine you're fired

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,679
and well it was the first time and

249
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,200
happily the last time I was ever fired

250
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,979
but I was fired summarily and I said

251
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,440
well

252
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,278
I'm a permanent member that was my title

253
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,279
permanent member

254
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,860
he said I'll tell you the difference and

255
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,179
when I started I was a temporary member

256
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,399
I was a temporary member and then I

257
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:24,838
became a permanent member

258
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,639
so he said I'll tell you the difference

259
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,500
between a temporary member and a

260
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,659
permanent member I said yes he said a

261
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,600
temporary member has a contract

262
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:35,219
well I guess it was true I had a letter

263
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,019
when I was a temporary member but when

264
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,139
it became a permanent member I didn't

265
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:44,039
have a contract and so there I was out

266
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:47,819
on my ear but not especially

267
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:50,759
worried and I did go against his advice

268
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,980
and I did take the job as chairman

269
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,299
at Stony Brook I figured

270
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,459
uh

271
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:59,958
it was better to be a fire Roar than a

272
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,958
fiery and

273
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:08,039
there was a fair amount of firing

274
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,159
regrettably that had to be done uh the

275
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,838
department was very weak but we hired a

276
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,600
lot of people we had a good time and we

277
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,540
did build a good department and I did do

278
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,240
some some mathematics there that ended

279
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:24,379
up with churn that ended up being a

280
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:28,200
pretty useful in physics

281
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:30,838
and uh and it was there that I did

282
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,899
learn about uh the bone marinop

283
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,399
experiment and the relation the apparent

284
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,500
relation between

285
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,940
what we mathematician called you know

286
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,860
bundles with connection and what the

287
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,459
physicists call Gage Theory and I did

288
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,620
run off to MIT and said not to MIT to

289
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:49,018
see is he was in I think he was at

290
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,519
Rockefeller that year and sat in some

291
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,740
place over coffee

292
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,259
and explain this connection

293
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,720
and it was a very very exciting time and

294
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:00,240
it was I think there were conversations

295
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,899
like that going on perhaps in lots of

296
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,839
coffee shops around about how physics

297
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,759
and the way it was evolving and the

298
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,940
geometric side of mathematics were

299
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,360
really becoming uh quite intertwined and

300
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,100
now they're

301
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,620
inextricably intertwined as far as I

302
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,959
could as far as I can see

303
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,679
so those were all those were all good

304
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:28,939
times but then as is said as he's been

305
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:32,578
giving my my talk uh

306
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,079
I did get frustrated I was stuck I was

307
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,479
really stuck in a problem I was trying

308
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,278
to prove a certain number was irrational

309
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,339
I guess you all know what an irrational

310
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,379
number is uh it might not seem so

311
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,320
important that a number be rational or

312
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:48,439
irrational but in this case uh it seemed

313
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,540
to have a lot of a lot of implications

314
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,820
and I was wholly incapable

315
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,500
of solving this problem and it's still

316
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,540
an open problem this whole area it's a

317
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,620
great set of problems about volumes and

318
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,120
whether

319
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,539
they're rational

320
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,860
in some sense so uh anyway I was I was

321
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,278
very frustrated

322
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,339
uh I had been I was on the wrong side of

323
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:14,578
of a divorce

324
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,380
I was on turned out on the right side of

325
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:18,059
my next marriage I did have a new

326
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,939
girlfriend who's standing sitting right

327
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:23,518
there my new girlfriend and

328
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,380
my South American Business at long last

329
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,879
started paying some dividends in fact

330
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,578
they started paying a lot of dividends

331
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:33,240
and I had some money and I invested that

332
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:34,078
money and found out that I wasn't bad at

333
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,200
it

334
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:40,319
and all of this

335
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,399
was made me think okay it's time for a

336
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,440
change and so in 1976 I was 38

337
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,600
I felt I'd been a mathematician all my

338
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,579
life but really sort of since I was 18 I

339
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,839
think I was so I I guess I spent 20

340
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:55,799
years

341
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,800
in that game and decided to to go into

342
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:01,439
business and never occurring that I

343
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:05,759
would apply mathematics to the business

344
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,800
Ivy did subsequently but I just felt you

345
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,799
know you read the newspapers you you you

346
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:13,319
think you'll do pretty well but and and

347
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:17,039
we did we did okay but after a little

348
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,120
bit I started collecting some data and I

349
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,919
figured

350
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,299
there's something to be modeled here

351
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,000
there's something to be modeled here

352
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:26,278
like we used to do in the old Ida days

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,639
so I brought in the best modeler in the

354
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:32,698
world uh Lenny a guy named Lenny

355
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,139
Baum from Ida and persuaded him to come

356
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,639
and we're going to make these models and

357
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,579
do great

358
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,620
and Lenny started making models and with

359
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:44,879
me and we were fooling around

360
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:47,459
but I kept trading and then Lenny seemed

361
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,159
to have got less and less interested in

362
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:54,539
models and more and more interested in

363
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:57,059
reading the news reel that in those days

364
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,740
it was just a role it would tick away

365
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,239
and you'd read the news and Lenny was

366
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,519
always reading the news instead of

367
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,919
thinking about models

368
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,120
and then he started having opinions on

369
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,620
what was going to go up and what was

370
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,259
going to go down this was all foreign

371
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:14,519
currencies bonds that kind of stuff

372
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:16,759
and I started listening to him and uh he

373
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,899
was right he was right

374
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:23,120
he was right enough times he said okay

375
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,120
the hell with the modeling let's just uh

376
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:31,379
let's just try to make some money and uh

377
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,939
we had a remarkable run in a two two

378
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:35,939
years since I said to Howard the model

379
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,279
and we multiplied our investors money by

380
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,380
12. now then that was even after that

381
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,439
phase that's a that sounds pretty good

382
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:47,100
right for uh it was we were incredibly

383
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,620
lucky see the last word up there is luck

384
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,440
Good Luck Good Luck Good Luck and we

385
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,519
certainly had good luck uh I've had a

386
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,660
lot of good luck

387
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,459
in my career so uh but in the back of my

388
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,919
mind was well okay London doesn't want

389
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,359
to build models but maybe we could build

390
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,220
some someone else could come in and

391
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,699
build models and another fellow Jim ax

392
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,919
who was quite a famous mathematician uh

393
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,779
left Stony Brook to come and and he did

394
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,660
build some models so

395
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:17,578
those next years was a combination of

396
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,439
fundamental trading I did venture

397
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:22,980
capital I invested in all kinds of

398
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,839
things but the models kept being built

399
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,699
and working better and better

400
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,918
and finally

401
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,080
at the end of about a 10-year run

402
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,000
it was clear to me that this

403
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,899
gut-wrenching business of fundamental I

404
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,940
mean

405
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,500
you know if you're doing fundamental

406
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,360
trading one morning you come in you feel

407
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,919
like a genius you know your positions

408
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,079
are all your way and you think God I'm

409
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,000
really smart and look at all the money I

410
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,159
made overnight then the next day you

411
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,679
come in and they've gone against you and

412
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,720
you feel like an idiot there was

413
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,000
we were pretty good at it but it just

414
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,779
didn't seem to be a way

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,079
to live your life you know uh so click

416
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:03,720
building models go with the model so

417
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:06,298
by 1988

418
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,880
I decided it's going to be a hundred

419
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:11,240
percent models and it and it has been

420
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,360
ever since in the business that we built

421
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,579
so some firms uh you know investing

422
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,439
firms say oh they have models and what

423
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:22,139
they typically mean is you know we have

424
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,820
a model and it advises the trader what

425
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,960
to do and if he likes the advice he'll

426
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,720
take it and if he doesn't like the

427
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,079
advice he won't take it well that's you

428
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,600
can't that's not science you can't

429
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,519
simulate how you would do how how was

430
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,798
how were you feeling when you got out of

431
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,619
bed uh you know 13 years ago when you're

432
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,119
looking at at historical simulations did

433
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,099
you like what the model said or didn't

434
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,219
you like what the model said that it's a

435
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:49,319
hard thing to back test so uh if you're

436
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,179
going to trade using models you're just

437
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,579
slavishly use the models you do whatever

438
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,259
the hell it says no matter how smart or

439
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:58,980
dumb you might think it is at that

440
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:00,419
moment and that uh turned out to be a

441
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,058
wonderful decision

442
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:06,059
so we built a business

443
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:08,160
a hundreds hundred percent based on

444
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:09,720
building computer models

445
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,419
uh

446
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,880
starting in those areas that that I I

447
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:18,240
mentioned currencies uh financial

448
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,400
instruments uh gradually uh moving to

449
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,679
stocks and finally to anything that

450
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,259
moved uh

451
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,620
well it had to be uh tradable how to be

452
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:31,798
liquid we were all was always liquid but

453
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:35,399
and you know bringing in data data in

454
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:38,339
those days we you know we sent gals down

455
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,440
to the New York Federal Reserve to copy

456
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:42,779
histories of interest rate numbers I

457
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,519
mean they didn't exist in the 70s you

458
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:47,819
couldn't go and buy data and it was

459
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:50,038
certainly not online deliveries of all

460
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,899
this stuff so to build the original

461
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:55,379
models we needed to collect a lot of

462
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,298
data by hand which we did and uh but

463
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,220
gradually

464
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:00,900
um you know we got smarter the models

465
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,019
got better we brought in more and more

466
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,519
people is said our we have the best math

467
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:07,259
and physics department in the world at

468
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,099
Renaissance I don't think that's quite

469
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:13,440
true uh on the other hand it ain't bad

470
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:16,859
uh we have a lot of smart uh Smart Guys

471
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,500
and uh and we certainly hired people who

472
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:21,779
were good at that kind of work

473
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:26,819
so we started this thing called The

474
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:27,660
Medallion Fund in 1988 in 1993 we closed

475
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,319
it

476
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,440
to any new investment by Outsiders just

477
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,960
employees could invest

478
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,700
by 2002 we started taking out the

479
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,819
outsiders all together buying them out

480
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:45,240
and by 2005 there weren't any left so

481
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:47,700
since then last five years this vaunted

482
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,359
Medallion fund has been owned a hundred

483
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,819
percent by by the employees

484
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:56,399
uh which today are about 300

485
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:58,500
300 employees

486
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,640
and well

487
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,319
so

488
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,240
people would always ask me well what's

489
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:04,798
the secret how come because we're not

490
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,079
the only

491
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:10,038
Quant firm in the world we're not the

492
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:13,558
only guys who have you know made models

493
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:15,419
I disparaged some who who model making

494
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:17,160
was sort of a part-time thing but there

495
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,500
were certainly other outfits but we seem

496
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,779
to have done better than than anybody we

497
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,298
had really established a remarkable

498
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:25,980
record so people always ask me well

499
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:28,200
what's the secret you know what are the

500
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,579
secrets not because I'm not going to

501
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,080
tell you the various

502
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:34,678
predictive

503
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:38,779
signals and so on and so forth

504
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,780
unless no I'm definitely not

505
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,000
we'll keep that that's even bigger

506
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,819
Secrets than that

507
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,538
their stuff down there at iea

508
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:54,538
it's these secrets are uh we try to

509
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:57,480
guard them but the real secret sauce

510
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:59,339
is that we start with great scientists

511
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,380
we start with

512
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:03,359
first class people who've done first

513
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,039
class work or we believe have reason to

514
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,319
believe we'll do first class work and

515
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,000
and because I was there at the beginning

516
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:12,200
and a few other people who had been

517
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,980
pretty good at math and science we had

518
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,360
we had good taste and that that's uh uh

519
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,940
stayed with the company

520
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,219
the second thing is we provide people

521
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,860
with a great infrastructure

522
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,298
and I've had people come to us from all

523
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:30,359
over when they come to work they said

524
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:32,579
they never saw it's more easy to get to

525
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:34,740
work here than anyplace else the data is

526
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:36,319
easily through we have someone in the we

527
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,240
have an alumnus here

528
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,339
that I saw earlier who could testify to

529
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,700
that I'm not going to ask him to do so

530
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:46,379
but he would so the infrastructure give

531
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,159
people a good infrastructure and I think

532
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,919
the most important thing that we do is

533
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,960
have an open atmosphere

534
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,799
so my belief is the best way to conduct

535
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,960
research on a broad scale is to make

536
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:04,259
sure as much as possible that everybody

537
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,819
knows what everybody else is doing at

538
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:07,259
least as quickly as possible sometimes

539
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,700
you got an idea you want to keep it to

540
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,579
yourself for a little while you don't

541
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,860
want to look like an idiot but the

542
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,298
sooner the better start talking to other

543
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,619
people about what you're doing because

544
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:19,079
that's what

545
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,479
what will will stimulate things the

546
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,918
fastest no compartmentization no we

547
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,720
don't have any little groups to say this

548
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:27,659
is our system and we developed it and

549
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,640
you you run it and we get paid based on

550
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:32,700
that and so on none of that everybody

551
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,280
meets once a week all the researchers

552
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:39,058
meet any new idea gets

553
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,940
uh brought up discussed vetted and

554
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:45,240
hopefully put into put into production

555
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,159
so it's an open atmosphere

556
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,140
and uh

557
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,880
and people get paid based on the overall

558
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,159
profits you don't get paid just on your

559
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,539
work you get paid based on the profits

560
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,380
of the firm so everyone has an interest

561
00:23:54,538 --> 00:24:01,259
in really everyone else's success

562
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,179
okay so why don't we have enough

563
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:04,919
I don't want to dwell on this point but

564
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:07,140
why don't we have enough teachers of

565
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,900
math and science in the high schools who

566
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,179
know the subject and one answer is well

567
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,100
if they knew the subject well they'd

568
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,620
also know enough to work for Google or

569
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:19,319
Goldman Sachs or God knows where because

570
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:22,019
today the world is so much more

571
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,599
Quantified and the economy is so much

572
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:29,279
more based on quantitative methods than

573
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:31,859
it was 30 or 40 years ago so uh the

574
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,798
difference in the quality of the job the

575
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:37,079
pay and the respect is so great for

576
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,158
someone who's actually qualified to do a

577
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,399
good job of teaching High School

578
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,299
mathematics that they get pulled away

579
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,519
and uh don't often find themselves uh in

580
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,558
in the classroom anymore so you have to

581
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,859
make the job better that means pay these

582
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:55,678
folks more which we do in New York

583
00:24:52,859 --> 00:25:00,119
through our program and a few other

584
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:03,780
cities and provide them more respect and

585
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:07,259
support which we do so uh you know if

586
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:08,399
you pay a guy 25 more and make them feel

587
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:10,319
or her

588
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,900
feel special

589
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,759
all of a sudden the career is a lot

590
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,500
better if you make the career better

591
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,480
people stay and will stay in their

592
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,480
career if it stays the way it is people

593
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,599
won't stay in the career and if we don't

594
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,519
do something

595
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,278
uh it isn't going to be a good situation

596
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,079
because one of as far as I can tell

597
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,640
and unlike most of the interviews with

598
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,798
you which I assume are largely about

599
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,360
your incredible success in in Quant and

600
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,579
as a Quant but

601
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,619
um is that one of your one of the

602
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:43,319
reasons you were so successful it seems

603
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:45,599
to me if I try and distill this is being

604
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,658
able to bring in really talented people

605
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,099
and let them run and with their talent

606
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,159
yes

607
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:55,859
and let them run uh

608
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:59,159
uh you have to have a good taste

609
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:01,798
in selecting people and uh but then you

610
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,159
don't sit on them you you you let them

611
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:07,079
do their thing and uh

612
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:10,559
that's uh

613
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:12,599
that's very satisfying and again when I

614
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,619
went into business

615
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:17,459
um

616
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:19,979
that was even more important yeah in a

617
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:24,298
certain sense and uh

618
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,319
I hired some terrific people there and

619
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:28,139
let them

620
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:29,639
as you say do your thing but do you

621
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,140
think your experiences chair helped

622
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,880
Prime you for that or not I mean the

623
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,559
sense of hiring faculty and saying okay

624
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,900
we think you're good now do good things

625
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,658
it's good

626
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:42,298
I mean I learned how to manage people

627
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,039
which is very difficult and something

628
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:47,819
you don't learn as an academic as a rule

629
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:52,200
right and uh so I left

630
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:54,839
Stony Brook I I think after eight years

631
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,419
and um and that's when I went into

632
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:00,119
business and uh

633
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,980
but I had learned to manage people

634
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,379
and uh

635
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:08,400
and I would I was

636
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,900
I was good at that I I uh well

637
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
recognizing talent and encouraging him

638
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,019
do the best thing is is great at

639
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,159
managing people if you can do if that's

640
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,019
what you can I mean sometimes

641
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,400
unfortunately there's the minutia of

642
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:19,918
other things that get in the way but

643
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,140
that's the heart of a good yeah that's

644
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,778
and and it's and it I it obviously

645
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,400
worked for you you and fortunately you

646
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:29,278
were you actually were able to build

647
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,620
look let me let me put this well let me

648
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,500
there's as far as I can tell again I've

649
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:37,019
tried to to think about your life having

650
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,538
been studying it lately

651
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:42,240
three factors probably are important but

652
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:44,640
one I I learned one was that you you you

653
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,400
had sold this company that had started

654
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,679
uh way back when in Colombia and so you

655
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,419
had a cushion you had a you weren't you

656
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,460
had a monetary cushion you weren't

657
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:58,259
quitting your job in some sense with

658
00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:01,880
worrying about feeding my family I did

659
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,879
and in fact uh

660
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:07,079
it uh

661
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,178
that business was sold

662
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,500
and uh

663
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,720
for

664
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,419
quite a lot of money

665
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,440
and uh

666
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:22,860
my friends said from Columbia okay now

667
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,320
we have all this money uh we want you to

668
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:27,178
help invest it

669
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,418
I don't know anything about investing

670
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:33,120
but I said okay I'll do that

671
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:36,080
and I found a guy a mathematician who

672
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:39,719
had gone into the Commodities business

673
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:42,839
and uh I went and talked to him

674
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,700
to see what he was doing and

675
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,439
he seemed to really know what he was

676
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,419
doing so I said okay we're going to give

677
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,778
you X dollars

678
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:55,500
you can have 10 percent of the profits

679
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:57,440
and uh we want you to uh make some money

680
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,240
for us

681
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,820
if you lose too much you have to stop

682
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,159
and he said what's too much I said well

683
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:07,439
if you're down 30 percent you you have

684
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,380
to stop but as I was walking out the

685
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,720
door I said and if you make

686
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,340
a tremendous amount of money you have to

687
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,200
stop

688
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:24,019
how much is that I said if you multiply

689
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:27,360
our uh the fund uh by a factor of ten

690
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:32,839
after your fees then you have to stop

691
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:36,119
wow and well he couldn't argue with that

692
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:38,459
but the remarkable thing was that after

693
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,918
a few

694
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,798
steps that he that he took that didn't

695
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:47,880
work he get into something

696
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:50,298
and made a fortune in nine months nine

697
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,520
months later he had

698
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:55,859
multiplied our money by a fact of 10.

699
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,740
wow and uh

700
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:00,778
much of that was in a Bermuda trust that

701
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,359
had been set up

702
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:05,700
for me by uh

703
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:08,879
the father-in-law

704
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,679
of one of the two boys because he was

705
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,539
very appreciative that I'd gotten this

706
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,240
business going in the first place and he

707
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:18,298
owned he owned half the business and he

708
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,298
uh he took a hundred thousand dollars

709
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:25,440
and put it in a Bermuda Trust for my

710
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:27,538
family oh and so that hundred thousand

711
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,100
was invested with Charlie and that

712
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:36,658
became a million so now I'm

713
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:39,959
gone so uh uh so I don't know how we get

714
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:41,640
into that but uh no well the the fact

715
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,399
that um

716
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,840
um that that well yeah I we got into it

717
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,119
by saying I knew you'd you'd had a

718
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,339
little you'd had a cushion financially

719
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,619
which would which allowed which makes it

720
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:55,259
a little easier to switch to to quit

721
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:57,538
Academia I think obviously the but the

722
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:59,940
other thing was that you had

723
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:01,980
um so that was certainly a help there's

724
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,840
no doubt about it and and it might have

725
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,778
been a harder decision if you were if

726
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:09,178
you were going paycheck to paycheck

727
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:11,640
um but but but also you also had a

728
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,860
cushion of intellectual Excellence you

729
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,600
were able to build on the investment

730
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:17,699
you'd made in humanity as far as I can

731
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,319
see you brought in let's see someone you

732
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,960
knew a very important person from The

733
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,058
Institute of Defense analysis who'd been

734
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,100
had been involved in creating an

735
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:28,859
important very important algorithm which

736
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:32,278
led to speaker speech recognitions right

737
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:35,639
um Baum is his name or something or yeah

738
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:38,640
and then also acts your great hire from

739
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,840
from uh so you you were able to say oh

740
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,820
I've got these really good people I

741
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,558
already know they're really good and and

742
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:47,398
I can bring them in that must have been

743
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:49,200
important it wasn't it was important and

744
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:51,898
um

745
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,240
at a certain we were doing fundamental

746
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:55,500
trading

747
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,679
uh initially

748
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:01,339
and that worked out okay

749
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,340
wait a minute

750
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,259
I should go well I thought we had 10

751
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,500
minutes left uh 10 minutes or so is it

752
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:14,519
yeah 10 or 15 minutes yeah

753
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:18,240
yeah maybe maybe 15 minutes thank you

754
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,158
uh I don't know where I was oh yeah it

755
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,440
was fundamental trading but finally we

756
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:29,340
get into uh making models and uh

757
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,860
they worked better and uh it was ever

758
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:33,359
since it was it was model making

759
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:35,759
and uh

760
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,459
and your experience in algorithms well

761
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,679
obviously algorithms became very

762
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,840
important as did

763
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,700
um machine learning I mean which which

764
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,199
were you directly exposed to machine

765
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,840
learning or is that something that we're

766
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,419
brought in by your colleagues machine

767
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:54,418
learning didn't exist in those days as a

768
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:58,020
notion I think machine learning has only

769
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:59,700
been around for about 10 years or uh 15

770
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,480
years

771
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,759
um

772
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,659
no we didn't uh we didn't do machine

773
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:08,819
learning but the uh the idea of of in

774
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:11,820
some sense

775
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:13,619
in in some sense looking at having a

776
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:15,178
vast Storehouse of data

777
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:18,000
that you could analyze and look for

778
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:20,159
patterns yes uh what became a central

779
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,798
feature obviously of what of what that's

780
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,500
what we did we had

781
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:30,839
a tremendous amount of data historical

782
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:33,720
data tick data even the tech we had a

783
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:38,158
ton of that and the way it worked is as

784
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,500
a guy would think oh well maybe uh

785
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,260
this would be a predictive signal and

786
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,700
he'd hook up something and then we could

787
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:48,240
test it

788
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,640
back tested for the previous 10 years to

789
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,000
see this does this really work and and

790
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,000
uh

791
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:59,099
if it was a statistically significant it

792
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:01,679
would go into the uh it would go into

793
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:03,538
the business so uh

794
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,700
that's the way

795
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:07,740
that's the way it will work and it's

796
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,320
probably still works that way yeah it

797
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,960
still works that way it's called black

798
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,300
box right but but and I'm intrigued by

799
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,820
that because in some sense

800
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,440
I've I've done a lot of discussions with

801
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,780
people in the past and and written about

802
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,119
AI but

803
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,460
um the idea that that that basically

804
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,220
patterns can be discerned that you might

805
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:32,039
not discern yourself but by by looking

806
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:33,598
at data enough uh and that's how Tesla

807
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,918
can look and find you know in principle

808
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,679
hopefully that someone's not a

809
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:41,039
pedestrian but a but a stoplight

810
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,019
um is is you is it a black box can come

811
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,300
up as saying this is what you should do

812
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,820
but it never tells you why you should do

813
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,260
it absolutely and and and it's

814
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,899
frustrating for people and I understand

815
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,460
early on you it was a natural tendency

816
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:55,618
for you guys not to believe it to say

817
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,019
look we have an intuition why should we

818
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,760
trust this machine telling us to do X

819
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:01,440
when there's no rational reason that we

820
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,260
can think of doing it I didn't worry

821
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,940
about that I didn't if it if it worked

822
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:10,560
it worked and uh but we had very strong

823
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,800
uh uh

824
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,659
oh

825
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,240
conditions

826
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:20,039
there's requirements yeah that can the

827
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,598
uh

828
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:23,599
the uh

829
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,639
the signal versus the the the rest of

830
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:34,199
the noise I guess

831
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:36,539
you know predictive signals and they

832
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:38,819
have to have enough statistical

833
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:39,719
significance

834
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,599
um

835
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,819
to uh put them into the system and

836
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,940
they're tested all the time

837
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,980
sometimes a signal

838
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:52,200
disappears after a while so you take it

839
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:56,159
out of the system what's happened is

840
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:58,739
that as the markets have become uh

841
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,838
electronic and computers have been

842
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:03,299
applied to generating prices and

843
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:05,279
accepting trades and all the rest the

844
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,359
markets have grown tremendously more

845
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,280
liquid

846
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,078
spreads have come down the bid ask

847
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,480
spreads have come down

848
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,420
the fellows who used to be you know the

849
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,460
Specialists on the floor Specialists of

850
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,559
all they were supposed to be the market

851
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,760
makers you know whatever it was full of

852
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,039
baloney they would create very

853
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,079
widespreads and at the first sign of

854
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,639
trouble they would they would disappear

855
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,140
uh

856
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,000
uh with

857
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:33,239
the Electronic Training has come the

858
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,219
ability to trade fast and that has

859
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,139
brought spreads down and in his broad

860
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:39,719
Market impact down so there's two things

861
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:42,239
that happens when you

862
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:45,959
buy a stock one thing

863
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:48,118
you pay a little typically you will pay

864
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,679
a little bit above the mid price just as

865
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,358
if you sell it you'll sell it for a

866
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,000
little bit below the mid price but the

867
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,619
other thing that happens is

868
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,699
infinitesimally perhaps you move the

869
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,440
market

870
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,578
well if you buy a hundred shares you're

871
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,960
probably not going to move the market

872
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,460
whether you buy a hundred thousand

873
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,780
shares you probably are going to move in

874
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:07,019
the market well how much you're going to

875
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,220
move it well if you're the only buyer

876
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:10,380
out there you're going to move it a heck

877
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:12,779
of a lot but if there's a lot of buyers

878
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,640
and and if you're the only if you're on

879
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,160
these sellers but if there's a lot of

880
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,980
people active in that market a hundred

881
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,838
thousand shares might go very easily so

882
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,119
the more volume

883
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,159
the better and it's volume that's been

884
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:30,480
created by these high frequency Traders

885
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:32,519
so I think the the research shows that

886
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,579
the costs of training

887
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:38,280
spreads and Market impact of them down

888
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:42,420
come down a great deal and it's all due

889
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,460
to high frequency Traders so uh is it

890
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,139
socially useful well if you think liquid

891
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,539
you know highly liquid markets are

892
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:50,480
socially useful then and I think so will

893
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:53,880
there ever be glitches and that could be

894
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,039
there was uh there was a glitch

895
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,920
I think they called it the flash crash

896
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:00,900
of a few months ago and for eight

897
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,960
minutes or so the market some Market

898
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,700
took a dive and they came right back

899
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,338
I mean it came right back no but I mean

900
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:10,139
it's an important point in 1987 when the

901
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:11,880
stock market crashed it went down 25

902
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:14,159
percent in half a day and it didn't

903
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,079
recover for six months because there was

904
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,819
nobody there on the other side they were

905
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,260
wrong

906
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,940
this thing recovered this flash class

907
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,220
recovery because someone had made a

908
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,400
mistake I presume some kind of order

909
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,959
went in that was much too big uh there

910
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,119
was nervousness in the market it was

911
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,280
already down three percent and it took a

912
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,260
dive and everyone stood back and said oh

913
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,820
my God what's going on well but then the

914
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,320
algorithms kicked in and you know uh

915
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,240
all this training just came back and and

916
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,099
this thing disappeared in 10 minutes so

917
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,500
it it

918
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,300
was a little destabilizing but it was a

919
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,699
whole lot

920
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,440
different from the crash of 1987 so

921
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:55,319
that's a long answer to a short question

922
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,358
yes I think high-speed trading is

923
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,838
socially useful and I think that the

924
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:03,199
people who argue against it are

925
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,199
wrong

926
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,579
not only the United States but in the

927
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,500
world looks kind of unbalanced unsettled

928
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,619
those big debts being built up by by

929
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,900
countries and we we have obviously a

930
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:18,539
recession in the United States and we're

931
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,338
we're busy bailing out Banks and you

932
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:21,779
know where's it all going where's you

933
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:24,358
know where's it all going

934
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,440
to hell in a handbasket or what and what

935
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:27,119
should we be

936
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,380
what should we be looking at well I

937
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,019
think all the things you mentioned are

938
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,480
worth looking at the national debt

939
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:35,820
has a fraction of GNP was considerably

940
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,800
higher even

941
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,800
than it is today right after the second

942
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,280
World War uh and we never paid off that

943
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,900
debt what we did was grow the GDP so the

944
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,540
denominator got bigger and bigger and

945
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,420
after a while we were back in the box so

946
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:53,880
uh there's nothing better

947
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,220
under most circumstances in my opinion

948
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,720
and some good growth and I don't think

949
00:39:56,219 --> 00:40:00,059
we're taking steps to the United States

950
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:03,419
to promote that good growth because I

951
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:05,159
think we should be maybe even printing

952
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,320
more money and building infrastructure

953
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:08,219
and doing some things that the country

954
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,740
has

955
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:12,838
is lagging in getting which would get

956
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:14,639
some more people back to work and would

957
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:17,099
put us in a better position to compete

958
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:19,799
even if we do have some inflation it's

959
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,820
not the worst thing in the world uh as

960
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,420
inflation

961
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:27,440
but uh

962
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,440
so I don't think there's any

963
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:31,500
you know what happened in this collapse

964
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,380
is

965
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,239
the United States got a lot poorer and

966
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,099
it got a lot poorer because the value of

967
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:41,039
everybody's house went down

968
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:43,800
and people's most of people's net net

969
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,179
worth was Associated to their home and

970
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,820
they had been borrowing against the

971
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:50,940
rising prices in their home you know uh

972
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,019
home equity loans that had fueled a lot

973
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,139
of growth

974
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:58,619
and that that came to a to an end so we

975
00:40:55,139 --> 00:41:00,559
had two bad things happen people's

976
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:04,680
balance sheets were decimated

977
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:07,380
uh and uh they had a uh not only

978
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:10,199
couldn't they borrow anymore but they

979
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,519
had to be paying back paying back debt

980
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:15,000
and

981
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,400
a balance sheet disaster

982
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,460
is not something it's just it's going to

983
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,440
get fixed very fast we we're it's going

984
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,320
to take a number of years

985
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,440
I think to rebuild

986
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,019
um to rebuild from from this base

987
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,760
and is the government doing the right

988
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:34,858
thing or the wrong thing I mean I'm not

989
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,440
a I'm not a big fan of this government

990
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:40,500
I'm not a big fan of the

991
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,700
of a tax bill that just passed except

992
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,858
that

993
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:48,618
uh it was well I have a there's a

994
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:53,420
Clapper up there no I

995
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:53,420
there's one Clapper uh

996
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:59,338
I mean it does it it made obviously it

997
00:41:56,338 --> 00:42:01,619
made no sense to continue the tax cut

998
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:02,960
for Rich guys like me that made no sense

999
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:06,180
whatsoever

1000
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,679
uh and and uh and for some of you out

1001
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:10,019
here probably it didn't make much sense

1002
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,239
but if that was the price to pay as it

1003
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:15,179
apparently was because we have a rather

1004
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,039
timid uh president that was the price to

1005
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:19,019
pay for extending the unemployment and

1006
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,239
making some other you know and and

1007
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:23,940
keeping the tax cuts for for Less

1008
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:27,059
affluent people uh and one thing or

1009
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,920
another it was it wasn't the worst thing

1010
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:30,480
in the world so it looks like maybe

1011
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,760
it'll it'll produce a little extra

1012
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,280
growth but that's what we need we do

1013
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,200
need growth and my own view is I'd

1014
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,140
rather have it at the risk of inflation

1015
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,659
than have no growth and and say we you

1016
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:44,699
know we we've held the dog value of a

1017
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,618
dollar who gives it who cares if

1018
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:49,199
everyone's out of work you know you've

1019
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,300
got twenty percent unemployment at a

1020
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,980
wonderful dollar is not gonna he said

1021
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:59,359
helpful okay

1022
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:59,358
the natural meltdown was based on

1023
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:04,139
mortgages being created that were no

1024
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:07,318
damn good

1025
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:09,000
and they were created because there was

1026
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,219
a market for them

1027
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,079
so these subprime mortgages you lend

1028
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:14,338
money to people that you would never if

1029
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:16,980
you were the lender you would never

1030
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:19,858
dream of lending money under these

1031
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,500
circumstances on the other hand if your

1032
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:24,659
uncle said don't worry uh you lend it

1033
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,699
and I'll buy the paper you might say

1034
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:28,559
well okay Uncle if you say you you'll

1035
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:30,480
buy the paper I'll lend the money you

1036
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,799
lend the money buy the paper sell the

1037
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,159
paper to the uncle

1038
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,680
uh this paper got securitized and at the

1039
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:40,500
end of the day

1040
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:42,838
stamped AAA now who the hell did that

1041
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,480
the rating agencies stamped this paper

1042
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:48,900
AAA and they stamped the AAA

1043
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,079
either because they were idiots which I

1044
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,139
think is largely the case uh

1045
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,420
but also because

1046
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:59,759
they were

1047
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,619
their fees were paid by the issuers of

1048
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,000
this rotten paper who wouldn't have

1049
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:05,160
issued it in the first place if they

1050
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,159
didn't expect to get AAA and then this

1051
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:09,719
whole chain this whole chain I mean you

1052
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:12,598
know in the old days you would go to the

1053
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:15,000
really old days you go to the bank you

1054
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:17,220
want to buy a house the bank actually

1055
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,260
was the one who lent you this money

1056
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:20,699
the bank was going to hold the mortgage

1057
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,599
the bank was going to service the

1058
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:27,659
mortgage and the bank wanted you to pay

1059
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:30,180
so the banks were you know but

1060
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:32,519
now a bank loans you the money for a

1061
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:36,659
micro second and they they sell it to

1062
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:39,119
the next guy so if the

1063
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:42,259
so it it had very little to do with

1064
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:47,338
Quant models it's true that quants were

1065
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:50,099
designing these uh these uh packages of

1066
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:52,440
mortgages but the the underlying

1067
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:54,240
statistics what's the probability

1068
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,679
that this mortgage is going to get paid

1069
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,379
what's the probability that a guy who's

1070
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,719
had seven jobs in eight years in four

1071
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,358
different cities

1072
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:06,000
uh and who was simply stated that he

1073
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,920
earns uh you know whatever what's the

1074
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,619
probability that he's really gonna pay

1075
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,119
off his mortgage

1076
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:13,800
anyone with common sense he common sense

1077
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:17,519
it up that would think it's pretty darn

1078
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:20,160
close to zero but uh but that fact was

1079
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,920
not taken into account in the underlying

1080
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,199
statistics so that's enough that's a

1081
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:29,519
long answer

1082
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:31,679
I will do one more I think lucky me when

1083
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,559
when creating models to trade the

1084
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,358
markets would you recommend focusing on

1085
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:40,380
creating models around fundamental

1086
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:43,259
economic data or on price Behavior such

1087
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:46,700
as the S P 500 or oil gold or

1088
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:50,400
combination of both thank you

1089
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:52,739
I mentioned Warren Ambrose in my

1090
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,440
beginning of my talk this mathematician

1091
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:57,979
who inspired me I'm actually going to

1092
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,980
answer your question

1093
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:03,539
and I went to him one day early in my

1094
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:06,539
career and I said Professor Ambrose I

1095
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:09,779
mean really early is it best to learn a

1096
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:11,460
lot about one area of mathematics or

1097
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,019
learn a little bit about a lot of areas

1098
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,358
in mathematics and he looked at me and

1099
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:18,119
he said one can make the cliche either

1100
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:21,119
way and that was the end of a discussion

1101
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:21,119
so

1102
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:25,199
there isn't any right answer to the

1103
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:27,960
question you asked all those things are

1104
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:31,439
good it's good to use economic models

1105
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,420
it's good to use uh you know uh price

1106
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,059
price histories it's good to it's good

1107
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:38,099
to use make models using all these

1108
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,019
things and there isn't any there isn't

1109
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,960
any right or wrong to that answer

1110
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:45,780
so

1111
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:48,500
I think I uh I'm imaginative

1112
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:51,740
I think I have a lot of imagination

1113
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,739
and uh

1114
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,980
my share of good ideas

1115
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,659
to

1116
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:02,818
bad one sometimes of course

1117
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:05,098
in fact when you're doing science uh

1118
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:07,559
you'll probably have five bad ideas for

1119
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:10,920
every good one but uh

1120
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:14,039
my friend Lenny Baum said uh

1121
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:17,519
he said bad ideas is good

1122
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:19,940
hmm good ideas is better

1123
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,858
no ideas is terrible

1124
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,240
and uh when you're doing signs you have

1125
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:28,679
a lot of bad ideas

1126
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:31,259
but uh you know uh but you got some good

1127
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:33,598
ones if you're a good scientist and now

1128
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:37,500
those carried today

1129
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:41,280
my idea of leadership of an organization

1130
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,719
is to hire the very best people you

1131
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,440
possibly can

1132
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:49,639
and I have a good taste in people

1133
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:53,700
and then let them carry the ball

1134
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:55,679
and when I became chair of the Stony

1135
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:58,439
Brook math department

1136
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,539
I reached out for the best person I

1137
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,639
could possibly find and he was your

1138
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:05,519
father

1139
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:09,420
and uh I knew if your dad would come on

1140
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:12,440
board it would open up the floodgates

1141
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:15,240
uh people saying oh well this department

1142
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:19,139
can really go somewhere

1143
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:20,219
so I spent a lot of time courting your

1144
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:22,219
father

1145
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:25,500
and uh

1146
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:27,838
finally he said yes

1147
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:31,500
and then I was able to quickly hire

1148
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:34,199
three or four other outstanding people

1149
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:37,139
and uh and we did that over the next

1150
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:38,578
couple of years I uh I only really have

1151
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:41,719
one hero

1152
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:45,359
in my life and at Annex Abraham Lincoln

1153
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:49,500
many people I admire and so on but as a

1154
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:52,500
hero it's Abraham Lincoln and he had

1155
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,858
the following qualities

1156
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,619
uh he had very very good social skills

1157
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:01,858
people like to be around and he told a

1158
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:03,660
lot of jokes and so on

1159
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:06,358
he was very smart

1160
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:09,719
he was very smart and his uh middle

1161
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:12,500
before he became president he decided to

1162
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:15,659
study euclidean geometry and understand

1163
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:19,079
that much mathematics just on his own

1164
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:22,019
because he was just curious and he was a

1165
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,880
very very smart guy

1166
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:25,679
thank you

1167
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,200
good social skills wonderful social

1168
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,419
skills and

1169
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:33,719
determination

1170
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:35,338
we had determination

1171
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:37,679
we

1172
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:39,599
there were so many times during the

1173
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:42,358
Civil War where he could have just said

1174
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,760
to hell with it

1175
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:48,900
just have two countries so many people

1176
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:51,839
are being killed in this terrible War

1177
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,400
but he had a vision

1178
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:56,159
of America

1179
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:59,039
and he stuck to that vision

1180
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:02,219
and and uh

1181
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:05,779
just wouldn't give up

1182
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:07,559
and over time uh he was right

1183
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:09,300
and that

1184
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:11,159
that entry together

1185
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:15,420
when the Civil War I say we won the

1186
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:18,480
Civil War the north the North

1187
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:20,220
and uh

1188
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,539
and then

1189
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:28,139
he gossed with great effort the

1190
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:31,440
amendment passed which abolished slavery

1191
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:33,719
in the United States yes and that was

1192
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,599
very difficult to get past

1193
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:40,078
but he knew he had a how to get it

1194
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:42,300
passed before the war was over and there

1195
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,760
were a lot of seven Southerners now back

1196
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,900
in the Congress and it would it wouldn't

1197
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,319
get passed

1198
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,180
and he said to his his guys

1199
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:54,358
he said

1200
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:57,299
this is very important I want you to go

1201
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:58,619
out and do everything you can twist

1202
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,380
every arm

1203
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:03,780
give people this or that if they if they

1204
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,160
feel they need it uh

1205
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:09,000
uh I'm the president of the United

1206
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:12,118
States um he was with great power use

1207
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,619
that power and get this uh Amendment

1208
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:17,519
passed and it worked yeah so uh I think

1209
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:20,099
it was

1210
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:22,440
just just a great man in every respect

1211
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:26,579
Euclid what he said was self-evident

1212
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:28,740
were the axioms the parallelism Axiom uh

1213
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:32,339
that was the toughest one two points

1214
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:35,759
describe a unique line and uh

1215
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:39,480
and the intersection uh principle so

1216
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:42,720
those he said were self-evident but from

1217
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,460
then on the theorems that developed from

1218
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,659
these were not self-evident they were

1219
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,240
all

1220
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:51,239
some of them looked obvious but

1221
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:53,039
nonetheless they were all proved using

1222
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:56,419
these initial

1223
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:59,420
quote unquote self-evident things

1224
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:03,000
now my

1225
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,858
discovery of Zeno's Paradox

1226
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,960
um

1227
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:08,639
when I was a little boy maybe three or

1228
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,559
four

1229
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:15,719
I was riding in the car with my father

1230
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:18,180
and he he said he had a stop to get gas

1231
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:20,699
I said why why do you do that he said I

1232
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:23,159
don't want to run out of gas

1233
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:25,318
because you know the car won't run

1234
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:28,379
and I said well

1235
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:30,719
why don't you just use half the amount

1236
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,599
that's in the tank

1237
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:35,399
and then use half of that and then use

1238
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,300
half of that

1239
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:41,099
Etc and you'll never run out

1240
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,800
you'll never run out of gas

1241
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:45,960
now it I didn't think it further through

1242
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,260
and realized yes but you'll never get

1243
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,260
anywhere

1244
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:55,380
do you think of math as beautiful in the

1245
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,599
sense that art is beautiful I mean we

1246
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:00,240
often hear this debate you know is

1247
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,500
mathematics discovered or invented I

1248
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:03,719
don't think people would say uh

1249
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,760
Michelangelo discovered you know the

1250
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:07,439
David inside of a block of marble even

1251
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,260
though he would say stuff like that but

1252
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,358
he actually created it but mathematics

1253
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:13,859
and what's chiseled into your wall in

1254
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:16,019
the Simon Center

1255
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:18,598
do you feel that that's you know

1256
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:20,759
discovered or really is it invented by

1257
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:22,920
the human mind and then the follow-up

1258
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,559
question after you answer that will be

1259
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:28,139
is it beautiful is it does it rank among

1260
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,440
alongside great music great artwork and

1261
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:33,358
if so why so first is mathematics

1262
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:36,059
discovered or invented the way art or

1263
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:39,119
the you know inventions are found yeah

1264
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:41,579
that's a uh standard question yeah and

1265
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,380
uh

1266
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:47,400
it's

1267
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:47,400
it's both hmm

1268
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:53,879
every true theorem

1269
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:56,640
is out there

1270
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:01,200
the number of true theorems

1271
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:01,199
is I believe infinite

1272
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,780
and the number of definitions that one

1273
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:10,680
can make is infinite

1274
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:12,000
so all these things are out there

1275
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:14,960
but

1276
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,960
on the other hand

1277
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:19,380
you don't

1278
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:20,760
know this there's no book of all these

1279
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,800
things because

1280
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:26,460
it's an infinite number of possible

1281
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,380
theorems and definitions the key is in

1282
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:31,858
doing mathematics

1283
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,780
to let's say find a good definition a

1284
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:38,039
definition that will get you somewhere a

1285
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:40,440
definition that will unify perhaps other

1286
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,699
things and so on

1287
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,639
so

1288
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:48,358
that's a creative act so it's a creative

1289
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:51,118
act to find something interesting in an

1290
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:52,558
infinite field in an infinite collection

1291
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,260
of

1292
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,760
of things so it's out there

1293
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,040
but

1294
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,380
you have to find it

1295
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:04,199
and have a good taste

1296
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:07,220
uh in in finding something that will

1297
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:10,078
really go somewhere so our segue between

1298
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:12,899
geometry and finance will be none other

1299
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,880
than Albert Einstein who once said that

1300
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,220
compound interest is the most powerful

1301
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,280
force in the universe compound interest

1302
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:23,058
is the eighth wonder of the world he who

1303
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:27,780
understands it earns it he who doesn't

1304
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:29,579
pays it uh do you agree with that uh I

1305
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,960
never heard that you never heard that

1306
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:32,940
okay I'll send you I'll send you an

1307
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,260
email with the quotient uh yeah so once

1308
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,420
again compound interest is the eighth

1309
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:39,000
wonder of the world he who understands

1310
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,159
it earns it and he who doesn't pays it

1311
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,659
what what is your notion of the what's

1312
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:45,500
the most powerful force in The World

1313
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:48,598
According to Jim Simons

1314
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,818
well the most powerful force in the

1315
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:54,539
world according to me is some physical

1316
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:55,858
Force I don't know which one to pick but

1317
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:59,818
uh

1318
00:55:55,858 --> 00:56:04,078
but uh this of course is finance finance

1319
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:05,579
and not uh and not physics so uh

1320
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,099
d

1321
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:09,420
uh I've been pretty successful in

1322
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:11,640
finance

1323
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,280
uh you've had some success I would say

1324
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:16,618
yeah I've had some success today

1325
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,559
actually I I

1326
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:21,300
lots of money no no not a huge thing but

1327
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,400
I'm here for you Jim if you if you need

1328
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:26,220
anything

1329
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,139
wants to know uh the proprietary

1330
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:30,358
algorithms of the of The Medallion no

1331
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:32,219
he's uh he wants to know has it become

1332
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:34,259
harder for you

1333
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:36,419
um given the rise in quantitative hedge

1334
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,940
funds Quant funds and the thousands of

1335
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:41,639
phds trying to create new algorithms has

1336
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:43,500
that made it harder to create Alpha so

1337
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:45,358
um can you say what Alpha means in the

1338
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,338
context of hedge funds uh for people

1339
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:49,578
that aren't familiar and then answer

1340
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:53,159
that particular question

1341
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:58,920
well when you say Alpha first you have

1342
00:56:53,159 --> 00:57:03,179
to understand beta and beta is the uh

1343
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:06,300
uh the stock market as a whole

1344
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:10,618
um let's say the s p average

1345
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:13,140
so you could just uh invest in that and

1346
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:16,200
you would be a hundred percent beta all

1347
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:18,118
your return would be would come from the

1348
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:20,779
let's say the s p the standard and

1349
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:20,780
Poor's average

1350
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:29,338
Alpha is

1351
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:31,380
a source of earnings that is orthogonal

1352
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:34,980
to that hmm

1353
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:36,059
it's orthogonal to that and uh so that's

1354
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,760
Alpha

1355
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:40,740
now some

1356
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,380
our Medallion fund

1357
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:48,058
is uh I think

1358
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:51,180
90 alpha or 95 percent Alpha it really

1359
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:54,480
doesn't matter where the stock market is

1360
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:57,919
going for The Medallion fund we have

1361
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,599
another Medallion fund is only open to

1362
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:04,680
employees of the of the company of

1363
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:09,318
Renaissance and me of course uh as a

1364
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:11,179
founder and shareholder so

1365
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:14,579
uh

1366
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:17,159
and and we have some publicly available

1367
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:20,280
funds which do have some beta they're

1368
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:21,779
not a hundred percent helpful and but of

1369
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,880
course they don't do as well

1370
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:27,420
as medallion

1371
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:31,099
but uh but they do uh quite well until

1372
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:33,720
today it had a bad day

1373
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:35,579
I'm sorry again I'm always here if you

1374
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:37,939
need uh if you need a cup of sugar I'm

1375
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,940
here

1376
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:42,960
um so in that space the question is um

1377
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,880
I've heard it described that these

1378
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,880
supercomputers and computers in general

1379
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,160
are of course increasing exponentially

1380
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,798
example of power computing power over

1381
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:55,139
time and cost is coming down and yet the

1382
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,338
super computers themselves are suffering

1383
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:57,719
from the fact that there's more

1384
00:58:56,338 --> 00:59:00,119
subscriptions there's more people that

1385
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:01,919
want to use the computer now than in the

1386
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:04,019
earlier days so it's sort of offsetting

1387
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,818
the exponential gains and processing

1388
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:07,980
power and I guess James altitude's

1389
00:59:05,818 --> 00:59:10,980
question here is has the just the net

1390
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,920
quantity of hedge funds and Quant PhD

1391
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,960
yes I understand that

1392
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,099
yeah I didn't answer that question yeah

1393
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,139
so

1394
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:22,700
I think the question is do we have

1395
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:26,400
competition and how much competition

1396
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:27,960
has competition hurt us

1397
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,780
because there are more and more

1398
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,760
quantitative funds up to a point I think

1399
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,980
most funds are not quantitative funds

1400
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,460
but they're certainly an increasing

1401
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:42,900
number of funds that are quantitative

1402
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:45,720
and uh our secret is just to stay ahead

1403
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:49,260
of everybody to hire the best possible

1404
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:52,019
people and the research goes on all the

1405
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:55,559
time all the time we're doing research

1406
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:59,280
trying to find new predictive signals

1407
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:01,859
new predictive signals uh for example

1408
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,839
that's a big example so a signal is well

1409
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:04,980
you know what a signal is it so it tells

1410
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:06,900
you what's

1411
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,579
a predictive signal was a signal that

1412
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,039
tells you what's gonna what's gonna

1413
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:13,200
happen there's some probability of right

1414
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,798
what's up with a greater than

1415
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:18,480
probability greater than a half

1416
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:20,639
and the more of these signals that you

1417
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,920
have

1418
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,900
an independent and not correlated with

1419
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,260
each other if they're highly correlated

1420
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:29,039
it's really just one signal but

1421
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,160
um

1422
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:36,480
the more you have the better

1423
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:39,058
and uh we have uh I won't even say the

1424
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,338
number and I'm not sure what it is but

1425
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:45,240
it's a very large number of predictive

1426
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:47,818
and they keep uh being developed and

1427
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:51,358
sometimes these signals lose their power

1428
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:54,358
yes and uh you have to discard them

1429
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:55,500
uh other people have caught on

1430
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:58,619
whatever

1431
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:00,059
in the earliest days of my

1432
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:02,780
Trading

1433
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:06,359
uh I traded Commodities

1434
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:09,420
and commodities had a tendency to trend

1435
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:11,039
a pretty strong tendency to Trend so

1436
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,139
that was a good way to make money you

1437
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:15,358
would just say well if it was up last

1438
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:19,318
week it's likely to be up next week or

1439
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:22,558
so on uh but people gradually caught on

1440
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:24,960
to trending so after uh

1441
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,298
several years or maybe

1442
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:31,019
10 years after I started in the business

1443
01:01:27,298 --> 01:01:34,259
it the trending in Commodities had uh

1444
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:36,179
completely disappeared the stocks never

1445
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,160
trended particularly so there was no

1446
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:42,000
real trending in charge but commodity

1447
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:45,199
killed us and so so that's an example of

1448
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,199
a signal

1449
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:58,260
discovering new signals other people uh

1450
01:01:55,019 --> 01:02:00,500
might find some of those as well and

1451
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:03,240
that might uh

1452
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:05,519
the effect of that might be but the

1453
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:08,578
signal kind of goes away because too

1454
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:12,298
many people are using it but um

1455
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:14,339
so we have awfully smart people and they

1456
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:17,039
keep coming up with new signals so

1457
01:02:14,338 --> 01:02:20,519
that's and we've stayed

1458
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:22,500
you know we've stayed with ahead yeah

1459
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:25,199
so one thing I've always done is do

1460
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:28,318
something new I love to do something new

1461
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:30,419
and I don't like to run with the pack

1462
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:34,259
uh for one thing I'm not such a fast

1463
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:35,760
runner so uh you know if you're one of

1464
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,859
end people all working in the same

1465
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,559
problem in different places if well me I

1466
01:02:37,858 --> 01:02:42,119
know I would I'd be last I you know I'm

1467
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,798
not going to win that race but if you

1468
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:45,059
can think of a new problem or a new way

1469
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:47,880
of doing something that other people

1470
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:50,640
aren't all working on at the same time

1471
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,619
maybe that'll give you a chance so

1472
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,019
do something new

1473
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:56,818
second

1474
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:58,380
collaborate with the best people you

1475
01:02:56,818 --> 01:03:00,900
possibly can

1476
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:03,180
when you see a person get to know a

1477
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,338
person who seems like a like a great guy

1478
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:07,618
or a great gal to work with in something

1479
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:10,440
try to find a way to do it

1480
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:13,680
because uh that that gives you some

1481
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:17,179
reach and some scope and it's also fun

1482
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:17,179
to work with terrific people

1483
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:23,039
I wrote down here be guided by Beauty

1484
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,720
I really mean that I think pretty much

1485
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,940
everything I've done has had an

1486
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,980
aesthetic component at least to me now

1487
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:31,380
you might think well building a company

1488
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:34,980
that's trading bonds what's so aesthetic

1489
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:36,960
about that but it is what's ecstatic

1490
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,179
about it is doing it right

1491
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,119
doing it right getting the right kind of

1492
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:43,558
people and approaching the problem and

1493
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:45,180
doing it right

1494
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:47,519
and if you feel that you're the first

1495
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:49,679
one to do it right and I think we were

1496
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:52,380
that's a terrific feeling and it's a

1497
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:55,980
beautiful thing to do something right

1498
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:57,838
it's also a beautiful thing to solve a

1499
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,818
math problem or create some mathematics

1500
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:02,818
that people hadn't thought of before so

1501
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:04,920
be be guided by beauty is not such a bad

1502
01:04:02,818 --> 01:04:06,900
principle

1503
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,720
and then I wrote down

1504
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:12,660
don't give up

1505
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:14,939
uh at least try not to give up

1506
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:17,818
and

1507
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:19,619
sometimes you can it's appropriate to be

1508
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:22,318
at something to be trying to do

1509
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:24,539
something for a hell of a long time

1510
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:26,338
and finally

1511
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:30,259
hope for some good luck

1512
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:30,259
so that's it

1513
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,539
okay
